<p>I started wearing glasses in 1995, and I switched to contacts in 1999. Two days ago&mdash;twenty years later&mdash;I got laser eye surgery. Here&rsquo;s the play-by-play.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/2018-year-in-review/">2018 Year in Review</a>, I mentioned wanting to investigate being done with glasses and contacts for good. So a month ago, I quickly Google-search for the closest laser eye surgery place<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> and go in for a consultation. After a brief eye exam, they tell me that my -2.5 left eye prescription and -3.25 right eye prescription make me eligible for the procedure.</p>

<aside id="note1">

	<p>This article is more about my experience than it is a review of the LASIK office I got the surgery done. If you&rsquo;re curious about how I picked, it was mostly based on a combination what was close by and reading great reviews on Google and Facebook.</p>

</aside>

<p>Eyes naturally change over time, so apparently about 5% of patients need an enhancement after a few years. They give me two different prices: $3,902 for the surgery with a lifetime plan that covers enhancements for life and $2,611 that only covers enhancements for 2 years after the initial surgery. They also offer a $200 incentive on each plan if I do the procedure before the end of the month.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have enough time to do the procedure and recover before some upcoming travel, so I put it off a few weeks, which gives me some additional time to think about it. <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design">Knowing a little bit about how people set prices</a>, the $200 incentive clues me in to the possibility that they might need the business more than I want to have unassisted perfect vision. A month later, I call back to schedule the procedure, and I tell them that I&rsquo;d love to do the lifetime plan but that I don&rsquo;t really want to spend more than $3,000 on this.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup> After a brief hold, they say that, in addition to the original $200 discount they offered, they can do an additional $500 off for local customers, bringing the total to $3,202. I accept their clearly-fabricated but still-gracious additional discount and pick a date for the procedure.</p>

<aside id="note2">
	<p>They offered financing too, but I&rsquo;m generally not a fan of that. I&rsquo;m not very disciplined when it comes to using credit, so I&rsquo;ll often choose to wait until I have the money to pay for what I want in full.</p>
</aside>

<h2 id="surgery-time">Surgery time <a href="#surgery-time">#</a></h2>

<p>They call in a few eye drop prescriptions to my pharmacy and tell me not to wear contacts for at least 3 days before the procedure. Eye drops in bag and glasses on my face, Em and the kids ride with me to the LASIK office. I arrive around 1:30<abbr title="Post Meridien">PM</abbr>. I fill out some paperwork, pay, and schedule a follow up appointment for the next day. I ask if I&rsquo;ll be able to drive myself, to which they answer a resounding, &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sit for about an hour, then the doctor calls me in. He says, &ldquo;Time to take your glasses off for the last time&rdquo;&mdash;a bit melodramatic but I&rsquo;m lovin&rsquo; it&mdash;and administers a few numbing drops.</p>

<p>While waiting for the drops to take effect, he asks me about my left eyelid, which droops down a little lower than my right. He asks me if it had always been that way, which I confirm. He mentions it won&rsquo;t be a problem at all, but that if it affects my vision in the future, I might want to get it lifted. I silently acquiesce, as he&rsquo;s not the first doctor to mention that to me.</p>

<p>He leads me into the operating room. An assistant asks me to lie down, and she administers more numbing drops (which I&rsquo;ve read apparently reduces your urge to blink). I&rsquo;m not positive of what happens after that since I don&rsquo;t actually see it myself, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what it feels like. <sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup></p>

<aside id="note3">
	<p>I confirmed a lot of what I thought was happening with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDWaKpk8Ygs">Louis Cole&rsquo;s laser eye surgery vlog</a>. Don&rsquo;t watch if you&rsquo;re squeamish.</p>
</aside>
	
<p>The assistant tapes my right eyelids open. The doctor applies some tool that locked the eyelids into place; I feel a little pressure on my right eye but it&rsquo;s ever-so slight. The doctor swivels a machine on top of my right eye, and I stare up at a red dot. I have both eyes open, and the doctor says, &ldquo;Your right eye is going to go dark,&rdquo; and suddenly, it does. This is the part where they peel back my cornea to get ready to do the correction <sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup>, but I don&rsquo;t feel anything here.</p>

<aside id="note4">
	<p>If you want to know how laser eye surgery actually works, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.allaboutvision.com/visionsurgery/lasik.htm">a complete guide</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>The same happens with my left eye; again, I don&rsquo;t feel anything.</p>

<p>The assistant asks me to get up slowly as she holds my hand. My vision is blurry. She slowly leads me to another station 3 feet away and asks me to lie down again.</p>

<p>The doctor swivels a new machine over my right eye. I remember less about the details of this one. I look up and see red lights in a cross-stitch pattern surrounded by green lights in the same pattern. I assume this is the laser that&rsquo;s going to do the correction. The doctor seems to have a tool and the best way I can describe it was like he&rsquo;s &ldquo;fishing around&rdquo; in my right eye. I don&rsquo;t feel this&hellip; more like I could see it, albeit blurry. Next, the laser seems to be doing something, and I smell a slight burning (I previously read about this, so I expected it). Doctor comes back with his fishing-around tool and then says the right eye is done. That wasn&rsquo;t so bad at all!</p>

<p>Next up: left eye. Doctor fishes around again, but this time, I feel it a bit. It feels like something grazing my eye. Laser does it&rsquo;s thing, then Doctor says something to Assistant&mdash;I can&rsquo;t quite make it out, but I think I hear the word &ldquo;scratch,&rdquo; which worries me a bit&mdash;then Doctor fishes around again. But rather than being done now like the right eye was, the laser goes for another round. That worries me too, because that&rsquo;s not what happened with the right eye. Doctor comes back to fish around, and tells me the left eye is done.</p>

<p>Doctor and Assistant help me slowly stand up, and Doctor says, &ldquo;You did a great job.&rdquo; This worries me even more, because he sounds like he&rsquo;s trying to convince himself as much as me.</p>

<p>I ask, &ldquo;Did everything go ok?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor replies, &ldquo;Oh yes, everything&rsquo;s great. Go home and take a nap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My vision is blurry at this point. I grab my stuff, throw some sunglasses on, and am escorted out to my car.</p>


<h2 id="the-drive-home">The drive home <a href="#the-drive-home">#</a></h2>

<p>Em drives me home. I&rsquo;m reclined in the passenger seat, and the kids are in the backseat.</p>

<p>I have my eyes closed, and I think the numbing drops are wearing off. Tears start to stream down my face, uncontrollably. I&rsquo;m not crying; at least I don&rsquo;t think so, but it feels like it, both physically and emotionally. <strong>IT. BURNS.</strong> My nose is running. When I keep my eyes closed, it burns. When I try to open my eyes, tears flood down my face. I can&rsquo;t keep them open for long anyway, so I close them again, which burns, so I want to open them. The cycle continues.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not allowed to rub or even touch my eyes&mdash;ever, apparently&mdash;so my beard and top of my shirt are getting damp from my tears. I try to fall asleep, but it burns too much. I fall asleep a few minutes before we pull into the driveway.</p>

<p>Em helps me out of the car. My eyes closed, she leads me into our room, where I settle into bed around 4<abbr>PM</abbr>.</p>



<h2 id="naptime">Naptime <a href="#naptime">#</a></h2>

<p>Official instructions are to nap for 3 &ndash; 6 hours after the procedure, because there&rsquo;s really nothing else you could do anyway. The night before, I stayed up late the night and woke up early so I&rsquo;d be tired enough to nap. The LASIK office recommended Tylenol PM&mdash;or Valium&rdquo;but I&rsquo;m usually a good sleeper, so I decide to go cold turkey.</p>

<p>Em helps me carefully tape sleep shields on my eyes so I wouldn&rsquo;t accidentally rub my eyes in my sleep. She put a glass of water on my nightstand and leaves me so I can try to get some rest. I start listening to a boring finance audiobook. Unfortunately, my eyes are still burning, which is keeping me awake. Also, the boring finance audiobook&mdash;<cite><a href="https://yourmoneyoryourlife.com/book/">Your Money or Your Life</a></cite>&mdash;turns out to be really interesting, so I&rsquo;m actually paying attention instead of zoning out.</p>

<p>After what seems like an hour, I switch to a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8Uebhn9wzrS?si=ztcBX52uQUSj6euJI4_t2Q">Chill Lofi Study Beats Spotify playlist</a> on low volume and finally start to doze off.</p>

<p>I wake up every 30 minutes or so. My eyes are still burning. I try to open my eyes, and tears flood out. I close them again and fall back asleep.</p>


<h2 id="after-nap">After nap <a href="#after-nap">#</a></h2>

<p>I wake up more fully about two-and-a-half hours later at 6:30<abbr>PM</abbr>, mostly because I&rsquo;m hungry. Eyes still burning, I open them; tears still flood out, but seems like less tears than before. I force myself to keep my eyes open as long as I can before shutting them again. I sit in the dark for about half-an-hour, training myself to open and close my eyes as normally as possible.</p>

<p>I start the recommended eye drop routine: a steroid eyedrop and an antibiotic one every 2 hours. I eventually feel stable enough to throw some sunglasses on and venture out into the kitchen. Em and the kids have kindly turned of most of the lights in the house, and they&rsquo;re hanging out in the basement so I&rsquo;d have a quiet upstairs all to myself. I look slowly toward a light, then stop myself, as my eyes seem too sensitive for that. I warm up a bowl of leftover pasta and eat it in the dark dining room, mostly to get used to being awake. My vision seems clear, but I do see some spots and too much light doesn&rsquo;t feel great. My eyes still sting, especially my left eye, which feels scratched (though I can&rsquo;t tell if that&rsquo;s just the power of suggestion from my worries about the procedure).</p>

<p>Em and the kids come upstairs to read stories, pray, and get to bed. I say goodnight to the kids, and hang out in bed with Em. We talk for a while, mostly about my surprisingly interesting finance book. An hour or two of engaging conversation later, I realize I haven&rsquo;t thought about my eyes once, and that, now that I am thinking about them, they don&rsquo;t sting as much. One of a many benefits to having a riveting wife.</p>

<p>Even though the pain is decreasing, I still can&rsquo;t really look at light without wincing. I can&rsquo;t fathom how I&rsquo;m supposed to drive myself to a follow-up appt just 12 hours from now. I do my final round of eye drops for the night, tape my sleep shields on, and get ready for bed. I took a nap just a few hours ago, but I&rsquo;m still tired from the tenseness of it all, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to sleep.</p>




<h2 id="the-next-morning">The next morning <a href="#the-next-morning">#</a></h2>

<p>I intentionally wake up at 5:30<abbr title="Ante Meridien">AM</abbr> (just about my usual waketime) because I want a few hours to get acclimated before having to drive to a 9<abbr>AM</abbr> follow-up appointment. My vision is blurry, but largely because I still have the sleep shields on. I walk to the bathroom, take off the sleep shields, and look around. <strong>Things are pretty clear.</strong> Also, almost no pain at all. Wow.</p>

<p>I turn the light on but brace myself. No light sensitivity.</p>

<p>I walk around the house. Life looks pretty good.</p>

<p>My care instructions say I should wear sunglasses indoors for a week, not because of light sensitivity, but as protection for my eyes so they don&rsquo;t accidentally get bummed or so I don&rsquo;t unintentionally rub them. I pop on sunglasses, marveling at the obvious difference from feeling so rough the night before and so good now.</p>

<p>I drive myself to my follow-up appointment with no issues. They test my eyesight: <strong>20/15 in each eye, 20/20 together,</strong> just 18 hours after the procedure.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re seriously living in the future.</p>



<h2 id="two-days-in">Two days in <a href="#two-days-in">#</a></h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing this post on two day after the procedure. I&rsquo;m following the eye drops routine pretty religiously, as I&rsquo;ve read that sticking to that increases the speed of recovery significantly. If my eyes itch, I&rsquo;m supposed to use artificial tears, as itchiness is a symptom of dryness. The LASIK office suggested that I use artifical tears as often as I want, so I&rsquo;m making liberal use of that. The worst of it is that my left eye still feels <em>slightly</em> sandy every few hours, kinda like I have a dirty contact lens in. But, it goes away immediately when I use the eyedrops.</p>

<p>I switched to sleeping in ski goggles last night instead of sleep shields, as it&rsquo;s a little more comfortable and still keeps me from accidentally rubbing my eyes. And my co-workers seem to be fine with me joining calls with video either turned off or turn on while I&rsquo;m wearing sunglasses.</p>


<h2 id="life-changing">Life changing <a href="#life-changing">#</a></h2>

<p>The biggest thing I heard from people who&rsquo;ve had this done previously is that it was life-changing to be able to wake up and immediately see clearly. I didn&rsquo;t really experience that this morning, partly because I&rsquo;ve heard it so much that I think it got overhyped and partly because I&rsquo;ve fallen asleep with contacts enough times to have experienced and remembered waking up with perfect vision.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s been more impactful for me so far is where I realize my previous habits and aren&rsquo;t necessary anymore. I don&rsquo;t have to take my contacts out before bed. I don&rsquo;t have to pack 2 weeks&rsquo; worth of extra contacts in a suitcase when I travel just in case I get stuck somewhere. I don&rsquo;t have to constantly carry around microfiber cloths to wipe dirty glasses. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about getting a contact knocked in my weekly basketball game. These are tiny things, but I think they&rsquo;re what I&rsquo;ll enjoy most.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/pricing-design">value pricing</a>&mdash;pricing work based on the value it brings your customer&mdash;here&rsquo;s a question I typically ask:</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;At what point does this project pay for itself?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Great answers I&rsquo;ve heard:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When 100 more students enroll.</li>
	<li>When we get an average of 5 more leads a month.</li>
	<li>When we add 1,000 more people to or mailing list.</li>
	<li>When people prefer us over our top competitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Answers I&rsquo;ve heard that make me think they&rsquo;re not ready for a project (at least not with <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a>):</p>

<ul>
	<li>I don&rsquo;t know.</li>
	<li>Why is that any of your business?</li>
	<li>There&rsquo;s no way we can quantify that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Smart clients know what change they&rsquo;re looking for, even if they don&rsquo;t know how to achieve it. (That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re hiring help.) Sometimes I&rsquo;ll try to help them <em>articulate</em> the value, but I don&rsquo;t try to <em>define</em> it for them. That&rsquo;s like going to a mechanic, and then deciding which part of your car you want to fix.</p> 

<p>In my experience, clients that don&rsquo;t initially know what they want turn into clients that stretch out rounds of review and aren&rsquo;t happy with the final result. Even when we&rsquo;ve delivered something that might work for them, they can&rsquo;t tell, because they don&rsquo;t know what the right thing is.</p>

<p>But clients that know what they want from the start? They know <em>way</em> early on if we&rsquo;re on track or off course, because they know the destination.</p> 

<p>A client that knows what they want knows where the project pays for itself, where it breaks even. And that&rsquo;s the first price ceiling. If they have a $5,000 budget and expect 1000 more signups, they&rsquo;ll think they overpaid if you try to charge them $10,000 and they get 1,000 more signups (whether or not that&rsquo;s accurate).</p>

<p>But what if you&rsquo;re confident than you could get them 2,000 signups? Then you may be able to charge $10,000 because you&rsquo;re delivering twice the results they&rsquo;re expecting. Here&rsquo;s the kicker: that&rsquo;s still a break-even price, even though it&rsquo;s double their stated budget.</p>

<p><strong>You can confidently price over any stated budget if you can demonstrate that you will deliver more value than their break-even metric.</strong> The more you understand the break-even point, the more liberty you have to assess and communicate the multiples of value you can deliver.</p>

<p>When you value price, every price you give a client should be at least a break-even price. Better yet, every price you give a client should be a &ldquo;they got a deal&rdquo; price.</p>

<p>Designer Zack Aronson asks an interesting question:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/danmall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@danmall</a> Watched the first 3 InVision Design System videos, thanks for doing those, been truly insightful. Any tool advice for a small design team (3 people) to get started on a design system? Sketch templates? Code templates?</p>&mdash; Zack Aronson (@ZackAronson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackAronson/status/1082006920138055680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2019</a></blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://publication.design.systems/">great articles about design systems</a>, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve seen much written about how to start one.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a> works with clients to create design systems, the first thing we&rsquo;ll do is an audit of the existing digital landscape. Do you have a public-facing website? A native mobile app? Some microsites? An intranet? </p>

<p>Of all of those, what are some interface elements that all of them have? Some common answers tend to include:</p>

<ul><li>Navigation
</li><li>Buttons
</li><li>Headings
</li><li>Lists
</li><li>Paragraphs
</li><li>Forms
</li><li>Tables
</li></ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to add everything that you think <em>might</em> go in a design system or <em>should</em> go into a design system, but try to resist that urge for now. Only include the components that <em>already</em> exist in all of the sites and apps. A good design system should be <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html#solvedproblemsandsettledscience">a collection of your organization&rsquo;s best institutional knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t use buttons a lot in those products, don&rsquo;t include them! Front-end designer <a href="bradfrost.com">Brad Frost</a> is fond of saying, &ldquo;A design system is the story of how your organization makes products.&rdquo; If your products don&rsquo;t have lots of buttons in them, including buttons as a prominent element tells the wrong story about what you do and make. This focus is key to making sure your design system remains <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/distinct-design-systems/">distinct</a>.</p>

<p>Zack: if I were advising your 3-person design team, I&rsquo;d suggest that each of you pick a component that&rsquo;s already used frequently in your products. Looking at <a href="https://www.echo.com/">your site</a>, those 3 components might be:</p>

<ol><li>Navigation
</li><li>Primary Heading
</li><li>Footer
</li></ol>

<p>Pick the best version of each of these. That might be the footer from an intranet and a navigation and footer from main website. And &ldquo;best&rdquo; might mean from a <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> design perspective, or that the markup is top-notch, or that it&rsquo;s built modularly&hellip; you decide.</p>

<p>Next step: put those 3 components somewhere. That could be a custom website you build, like <a href="https://material.io">Material Design</a> or <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com">Polaris</a>. But it could also be a wiki somewhere within your firewall. Or a Github repository. The important thing is that it contains: </p>

<ul><li>At least some front-end code you need to implement this component (because <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/your-sketch-library-is-not-a-design-system/">a Sketch library is not a design system</a>)
</li><li>Some guidelines on how (and how not) to use this component
</li><li>A <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> that you can send to someone
</li></ul>

<p>Congratulations on launching <code>v1</code> of your design system! That&rsquo;s right: <code>v1</code> of a design system can just be 3 components. Heck, it can be only 1 component! If that 1 component saves you some time on your next project and makes everything that much more consistent from both a design and code standpoint, you&rsquo;re experiencing the full benefits of a design system.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think</span> I was one for year-end round-ups, but reading <a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/12/twenty-eighteen/">Dave Rupert</a>&rsquo;s made me want to do one of my own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m generally a &ldquo;glass half full&rdquo; kind-of-guy, so while 2018 had both ups and downs, it was a pretty good year overall. In no particular order, some observations about my year and what I&rsquo;m looking forward to for 2019. </p>

<h2>Ten</h2>

<p><a href="http://emilymall.me/">Em</a> and I celebrated our ten-year wedding anniversary in 2018! We wanted to do a big celebration bash, but alas: we&rsquo;re both pretty terrible at follow-through for this kind of thing, so it never happened. We&rsquo;ve hired some help this time around, so hopefully we&rsquo;ll celebrate our 11th anniversary in 2019 with the Ma11 Ba11 (I know, I know&hellip; my logo designer is showing).</p>

<h2>Kids</h2>

<p>Parenting 2 daughters is more fun than it&rsquo;s ever been. I&rsquo;ll admit: as much as I tried to be a present and active dad, I wasn&rsquo;t really sure how to have fun and play with them as babies. That was really difficult for me. Now that they&rsquo;re older, I love so many more of the things we can do together! We've been playing a lot of board games like Clue, Battleship, and Taboo. </p>

<p>Sidda reads books and comics in her bed as a way to fall asleep every night. (She&rsquo;s currently into the <a href="https://amzn.to/2SAUsMI">Raina Telgemeier</a> series.)  She started ice skating lessons too and is loving that. We're talking about taking a trip together soon, just the two of us.</p>

<p>Charlie&rsquo;s asked me to give her piano lessons and practices on her own without prompting. She's frustrated that she can&rsquo;t read like big sis, which I think is the exact motivation that&rsquo;s going to get her to read. She draws letters constantly. </p>

<p>They both learned to swim this summer; Sidda&rsquo;s pretty fearless in the water now, while Char is still a bit hesitant. I bet one more summer of swimming will build that full confidence.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re also in the same school again after a year of being in different schools. It's a little weird as Seventh-day Adventists to have them in a Catholic school, but the school is great and it gives us the opportunity to talk about things like confirmation and baptism and whether or not they want to take part, which we leave up to them. It's also interesting to see them figure out how their relationship as sisters compares to their relationship to their friends.</p>

<p>Also, I think they both have boyfriends now.</p>

<p><img src="http://danmall.me/articles/2018-year-in-review/raven.gif" alt="Dread" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to more adventures with them in 2019.</p>

<h2>Taking care of my body</h2>

<p>I did some better things for my mind and body this past year. </p>

<p>I love soda and I really don&rsquo;t like drinking water. That&rsquo;s not a great combo, so I changed some of that around in 2018. First, I realized that I much prefer cold water to room temp, so I got a <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/21-oz-standard-mouth-flex/color,lava,a,92,o,54">HydroFlask bottle</a> that&rsquo;s always filled with ice water. I also realized that some flavor in my water goes a long way, so my bottle is always filled with lemon, lime, oranges, strawberries, mint, cantaloupe, watermelon, or some combination of those. Those factors increased my water intake from virtually none to some. I also think that means that I drink soda less, but that might just be an unsubstantiated feeling. I quit soda in 2013 for about a year but am back on the sauce; perhaps 2019 is the year I quit again, or at least reduce my soda intake some.</p>

<p>I played basketball just about every Monday night. It&rsquo;s a competitively friendly full court run for 2 hours. Looking forward to continuing that again in 2019.</p>

<p>I also made more of a concerted effort to lift or do some form of calisthenics a few times a week. I'm less regular during busy work weeks, but I was going at least once or twice a week for a good stretch. Rather than do an intense program, <a href="https://twitter.com/octaviusanewman">Octavius Newman</a> turned me on to Jim Wendler&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.lift.net/workout-routines/wendler-5-3-1/">5/3/1 workout</a>, which is more about a slow and methodical way to build strength over a long term. This is much more my speed and pace, as I tend to get discouraged over workout programs if I lose my regularity about them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting tired of contacts every day like I&rsquo;ve had for the last 24 years, so I&rsquo;d like to investigate laser eye surgery for 2019.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also had the idea for a few years to get the same or similar tattoo as my <a href="http://v2.danielmall.com/archives/2006/06/26/grandpa.php">grandfather</a> had from his time in the Filipino navy. After a conversation about tattoos with <a href="https://trentwalton.com/">Trent Walton</a> earlier this year, I think 2019 is the year that I make this happen.</p>

<h2>Good for the sole</h2>

<p>I really indulged my sneaker fetish this year. </p>

<p>I added these to my collection: Jordan 1 Mid University Gold; Jordan 1 Retro High OG Top 3; Air Max 97 JDI; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Racer Pink; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Dynamic Yellow; Nike Acronym x Air Presto Mid Cool Grey; Jordan 1 &ldquo;Homage to Home&rdquo;; Jordan 1 Mid Royal Splatter; Puma Roma; Nike Air Safari OG 2018; Jordan 1 Black/White RE2PECT; Nike SF Air Force 1; Jordan 1 Ret Hi NYC; and Air Jordan 1 Retro High.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a side project or two that I'd like to do around my sneaker collection. Maybe 2019 will be the year. Probably not though. </p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>As one who didn&rsquo;t travel much as a kid, I feel very fortunate every year I get to visit other places in the world. In 2018, I took both work and non-work trips to Cambridge, MA; Chicago, IL; Greensboro, NC; Salt Lake City, UT;  Las Vegas, NV; Faroe Islands; New York, NY; Seattle, WA; Toronto, Ontario; Marin County, CA; Cayman Islands; Washington DC; Strathmere, NJ; Mayfield, OH; Brooklyn, NY; Paris, France; Zurich, Switzerland; Orlando, FL; and Houston, TX. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to visiting more amazing places in 2019.  So far, I&rsquo;ve got trips lined up to Chicago, IL; Austin, TX; Seattle, WA; Boston, MA; and Toronto, Ontario, and likely adding Scotland, New Zealand, Japan, and China to the list.</p>

<h2>Conferences, workshops, and training</h2>

<p>In 2018, I spoke at 11 conferences, both virtually and in-person: <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/design-systems-virtual-summit-2018">UXPin Design Systems Virtual Summit 2018</a>; LoopConf; <a href="https://aycl.uie.com/virtual_seminars/which_new_skills_should_designers_pursue">UIE All You Can Learn Library</a>; Generate Conference NYC; Smashing Conference in <a href="https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2018/">Toronto</a> and <a href="https://smashingconf.com/ny-2018/">New York City</a>; An Event Apart in <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/washington-dc-2018"> Washington DC</a> and <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/orlando-2018">Orlando</a>; <a href="https://frontendconf.ch/">Frontend Conference</a>; <a href="https://conference.awwwards.com/new-york/">Awwwards Digital Thinkers Conference</a>; and <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/2018">Clarity Conference</a>.</p>

<p>In 2019, I&rsquo;ll be speaking at <a href="https://bureauofdigital.com/event/owner-summit-2019">Owner Summit</a>; An Event Apart in <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/seattle-2019">Seattle</a> and <a href="https://aneventapart.com/event/boston-2019">Boston</a>; and <a href="https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/">Smashing Conference Toronto</a>. I&rsquo;ll be adding to that list as the year progresses, so watch this space.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to add more training to my repertoire in 2019. <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a> and I are excited to help designers an developers collaborate better, starting with a <a href="https://designdevjan2019.splashthat.com/">workshop in Philly</a>! We'll be doing a few more of these public workshops throughout the year; more details on that soon. If you&rsquo;re interested in us doing a private workshop for your organization, <a href="/contact/">drop me a line</a> and let&rsquo;s talk.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also putting some plans together for some specialized training. I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of resources to help mid-level designers at startups and agencies get over the hump to being art directors and design directors, so I&rsquo;m developing a curriculum specifically for this. It&rsquo;ll likely be about a week-long, intensive workshop. It won&rsquo;t be cheap, but we&rsquo;ll work hard, eat well, and build a strong support network. More on that soon.</p>

<p>Video will be a format I lean into much more for 2019. I'm so inspired by watching my friends <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curlswithcoral/">Coral Rosado</a> and <a href="https://m.youtube.com/joshluciano?uid=ub6zWFUf0P9Kp8AI6k797A">Josh Luciano</a> grow their skills and audience on their Instagram and YouTube channels, and I already got a decent taste with the <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/design-system-manager/expert-advice">Design Systems: Mastering Design at Scale</a> series <a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a>,  <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>, and I produced with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, as well as <a href="http://skl.sh/superfriendly">my Skillshare class on Design Systems</a>. I&rsquo;ve officially caught the video bug.</p>

<h2>Concerts</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a musician since I was 3, but I haven&rsquo;t historically gone to many concerts. In 2018, Em and I changed that by going to see Lauryn Hill, Jennifer Lopez, Kendrick Lamar, Kenny Chesney, Beyonc&eacute; &amp; Jay-Z. We were also going to see Justin Timberlake, but <a href="https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/justin-timberlake-tour-cancelation-coachella/">he bruised his vocal chords</a>. Feel better soon, JT.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>I did a decent amount of reading in 2018. I read or started to read <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2BVdMgt">Getting to Yes</a></cite> by Roger Fisher; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2VnlWai">Principles: Life and Work</a></cite> by Ray Dalio; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Ru8X7x">Batman: Nightwalker</a></cite> by Marie Lu; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SyPIXC">The Art of Screen Time</a></cite> by Anya Kamenetz; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SyPIXC">I Will Teach You to Be Rich</a></cite> by Ramit Sethi; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SseY1M">It Doesn&rsquo;t Have to be Crazy at Work</a></cite> by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson; <cite>Batman Vol 1–7</cite> by Tom King; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SwMJ29">Artemis</a></cite> by Andy Weir; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2SCV98h">The Snowball System</a> by Mo Bunnell; <a href="https://amzn.to/2CM4qoP">The Spaceship Next Door</a></cite> by Gene Doucett; and <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Sy3bPs">To Sell is Human</a></cite> by Daniel H. Pink. That feels pretty inadequate compared to Em&rsquo;s goal of 100 books every year, but I&rsquo;ll settle for about one per month.</p>

<h2>Miscellany</h2>
<ul><li>We got 2 orange tabby kittens: Nala and Simba. They&rsquo;re annoying, but  the kids love them.
</li><li>We&rsquo;ve been inviting friends over semi-regularly for board games and/or karaoke. They&rsquo;re a ton of fun and laughs; more of this in 2019.
</li><li>I attended more funerals and viewings than I cared to this year (or ever), including one for my uncle who was the patriarch of our large extended family, as well as for my former college roommate who passed away from Hodgkin's lymphoma. Fuck cancer.
</li><li>I was <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/915520902607106048">randomly selected for screening at airports</a> 4 times in 2018. 
</li><li>I wrote <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/">11 blog posts</a> in 2018. That's down up from 5 in 2017, down from 12 in 2016, and on par with 11 in 2015. 
</li></ul>

<h2>Clearing my plate for 2019</h2>

<p>Work-wise, I&rsquo;d like to change things a bit in 2019. I&rsquo;ve spent the last few years learning and practicing how to direct projects. That means largely being in charge of the vision for what SuperFriendly teams would make, and how. That also means that while I was involved in many projects, I was rarely directly responsible for the main output myself. </p>

<p>For 2019 projects, I&rsquo;m going to try to be responsible for more output myself. That means I&rsquo;ll be working in design tools and code a lot more. I know I typically tend to be in this mode all by myself, so I&rsquo;m going to challenge myself to continue to work with the same amount of people, but more as a collaborator than a director.</p>

<p>To do this, I know I&rsquo;ll need more familiarity with tools and technologies. I spent some time during the holidays learning the fundamentals of both Rails and Laravel and building a few &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; examples. I&rsquo;m beefing up my React chops in preparation for a few upcoming projects. I have a post drafted about design tooling. I&rsquo;m learning Swift so I can design and build an iPhone app end-to-end myself.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a lot. In order to do all of that, I have to clear my plate a bit of things that I think I&rsquo;m done with, either for now or forever. </p>

<p>For the last 6 months or so, I&rsquo;ve had the feeling that certain chapters of my life are closing, while others are opening. But I&rsquo;m not sure which ones are which. So, I&rsquo;ve been taking inventory of all the things in my life, both personally and professionally, to see what things have run their course. This has included everything from taking a sabbatical to moving to a different state to shutting down SuperFriendly and taking a full-time job somewhere to being a full-time stay-at-home dad, and everything in-between. I&rsquo;m not quite ready to share any conclusions from this meditation&mdash;not even sure I have any quite yet&mdash;but there are a few things that are a bit clearer than others.</p>

<ul><li>I&rsquo;ve <a href="/articles/passing-the-superbooked-baton/">passed the baton for SuperBooked</a> to my partner, <a href="https://twitter.com/philipzaengle">Phil Zaengle</a>.  I&rsquo;ll still be involved with this product that I love, but in more less frequent capacity.
</li><li>Unintentionally, I opened a small <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">design and development apprenticeship</a> in 2012. After almost 7 years, I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;ve had almost 20 apprentices. That&rsquo;s a lot! I think I&rsquo;ve given all I have to offer here; I no longer have the desire to scratch this particular itch. So, as of 2019, I&rsquo;m closing the apprenticeship. 
</li></ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the opportunities this new year can bring that I have some space for. Bring it on, 2019!</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m getting ready to close up shop for the year and recharge for 2019, I&rsquo;m in a reflective mood. Every year, I&rsquo;m incredibly privileged to work with clients that pay me to do something I enjoy, and this year was no exception.</p>                

<p>After <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a>&rsquo;s first year of business in 2012, I published <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/superfriendly-annual-report-2012/">an annual report</a> that looked at workload, clients, and tasks at a high level. Visualizing data in aggregate like this has always helped me be intentional what I&rsquo;m currently doing and what I might want to change moving forward.</p>

<p>2019 will mark year seven for SuperFriendly. As a <a href="https://www.adventist.org/en/">Seventh-day Adventist</a>, I&rsquo;m a big believer in the value of cycles of seven, which often bring completeness and wholeness. It seems like an appropriate time for some more reflection.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a rough breakdown of the distribution of work per year. Clients are represented by their main brand color (at the time of working with them) and roughly sequenced by where the work occurred during the year.</p>

<h2>2018</h2>    
<img src="2018.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2018" /> 

<h2>2017</h2>    
<img src="2017.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2017" /> 

<h2>2016</h2>    
<img src="2016.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2016" /> 

<h2>2015</h2>    
<img src="2015.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2015" /> 

<h2>2014</h2>    
<img src="2014.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2014" /> 

<h2>2013</h2>    
<img src="2013.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2013" /> 

<h2>2012</h2>    
<img src="2012.svg" alt="SuperFriendly client work for 2012" />

<p>A few things I noticed when doing this exercise:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I&rsquo;ve long followed the mantra that no single client should be responsible for 50% of revenue, but I also apply that in terms of attention. I&rsquo;m pleased to say that that&rsquo;s held through since day 1. The closest we&rsquo;ve gotten (in terms of attention, not revenue) are a 38% client in 2012, a 32% clients in 2013, and a 37% client in 2015.</li>
    <li>The number of clients per year is slowly dwindling, which I&rsquo;m happy about. We&rsquo;re able to do better work for a smaller number of clients with revenue and profit still increasing. We had 17 clients in 2012, while 2018 wrapped up with 11 clients.</li>
    <li>Attention seems to be normalizing over the years. In 2012, we had a lot of little projects and one gigantic project. This past year, the distribution seems much more even.</li>
    <li>Though you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell by the scale of these graphs, we&rsquo;re spending less time overall on work. The number of hours we&rsquo;ve put in this past year is about 8% lower than we did in 2012, which makes sense if you compare that with the fact that we worked with 6 less clients. But that also means we&rsquo;re spending a little more time with each client.</li>
    <li>Revenue is up 51% from 2012, while profit is down 32%. Hmm, that&rsquo;s definitely something to fix for 2019.</li>
</ul>

<p>What did you learn about your business over the last year? What more can I tell you about mine?</p>

<p>Happy holidays, superfriends, and see you all in 2019!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>In 2013, I shared an idea I had for better referring work around with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/philipzaengle">Philip Zaengle</a>. Six months later, he came back to me with a prototype of how it might work. Without Phil, <a href="https://superbooked.com/">SuperBooked</a> would still be an idea floating around in my head. We worked on it for two years and then <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/superbooked/">launched SuperBooked</a> to a small audience of friends and testers in August 2016.</p>

<p>But then we slowed down. Alongside making SuperBooked, I run <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a> and Phil runs <a href="https://zaengle.com/">Zaengle Corp</a>&mdash;and running our own shops is part of the reason we use SuperBooked ourselves. Our teams run successfully but differently, and mashing them together isn&rsquo;t exactly a recipe for smooth sailing. Phil has staff that move on and off of projects based on production schedules, while my teams expand and contracts on a per project and per pipeline basis. These are neither strengths or weaknesses but operational differences that create logistical challenges when making a product together. Combine that with being (thankfully) busy with client work, and we knew we had to change something.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to make due with a process that&rsquo;s half mine and half Phil&rsquo;s, it makes more sense for one of us to step up and the other to talk a step back. As of today, Phil will become SuperBooked&rsquo;s new <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>. He&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s really gotten it to this place so far, and he&rsquo;s the perfect person to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>My role will be more of an advisor to the team. We&rsquo;ll still check in frequently about the ways I think SuperBooked can get ahead of where the industry is headed. I believe in SuperBooked more than ever. I really want to see it come to fruition, and that can best happen if I get out of the way.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of our beta testers for the fantastic feedback and sticking with us while we figure this thing out. And if you&rsquo;re keen on a better way to get and give amazing work, keep your eyes peeled for where SuperBooked goes next.</p>

<p>For the last few years, the majority of my work has been with organizations that either need help creating a design system or need help evolving one. I've been fortunate to do that with with my superfriends and colleagues <a href="http://bigmedium.com/">Josh Clark</a> and <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>.  We've worked both individually and collectively with organizations like <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/unity-design-system-exxonmobil.html">ExxonMobil</a>, the <a href="http://superfriend.ly/helped/seventh-day-adventist-church/">General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists</a>, athenahealth, Target, <abbr>IQVIA</abbr>, the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Progressive Insurance, Rescue.org, and more. Now, we&rsquo;ve partnered with our superfriends at InVision to share some of our learnings with the world. We&rsquo;re proud to to announce <a href="https://invs.io/2AN0mnb">Design Systems: Mastering Design at Scale</a>!

<p>We&rsquo;ll be releasing a few more episodes over the coming months on topics like getting buy-in, collaboration, governance, and more. Enjoy!</p>

<p>On <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/329-dan-mall-building-portfolio/">Episode 329</a> of <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show</a>, I joined <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a> and <a href="https://daverupert.com/">Dave Rupert</a> to talk about the role <a href="/articles/portfolios/">portfolios</a> have in getting a ful-time job, and how you can increase your odds of getting a job. We talked about many things, one of which was the all-time popular objection: &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t have anything good to put in my portfolio!&rdquo; So, we&rsquo;re putting our money where our mouth is and looking for an up-and-coming new designer to work with me to redesign the Shop Talk Show website!
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal: I&rsquo;ll <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/on-creative-direction/">creative direct</a> it, you design it. That means I&rsquo;ll be providing oversight, ideas, inspiration, and guidance while you do the actual pixel-pushing in Sketch/Photoshop/Figma/whatever to make the screens we&rsquo;ll all need. Chris and Dave act as clients, but will also be coding what we come up with.</p>

<p>We want this to be an opportunity for a designer who might have have something like it otherwise. If you have lots of portfolio pieces, this probably isn&rsquo;t the gig for you. If you work full-time as a designer somewhere, this probably isn&rsquo;t the gig for you.</p>

<p>Some criteria for our ideal designer:</p>

<ul>                    
    <li>You&rsquo;re in an underrepresented group in this field.</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;re looking to change careers from whatever you&rsquo;re currently doing into becoming a full-time designer.</li>
    <li>You need an opportunity like this project to break into the field, because you&rsquo;ve had a difficult time getting someone to hire you to do design work for them.</li>
    <li>You have some tolerance for hard work and transparency. Chris, Dave, and I all have an affinity for <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2012/09/23/working-in-public/">working in public</a>, so that&rsquo;ll likely be some part of this. Be prepared for some amount of live-streaming conversations, posting work before it&rsquo;s done, and being able to publicly track the progress of this work.</li>
    <li>You&rsquo;re a Shop Talk Show listener (at have least listened to an episode or two).</li>
</ul>

<p>Still here? Great! We&rsquo;re taking applications for this opportunity until about October 1, at which time we&rsquo;ll sort through the applications to see if there&rsquo;s a good fit. Without further ado&hellip;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://shoptalkshow.superfriend.ly/">Apply here!</a></strong></p>

<p>Chris, Dave, and I would love any comments or feedback you have about how we can make this better for everyone involved (including everyone sitting on the sidelines, watching all this unfold). If you have any questions, <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall">tweet at me</a>, either publicly or privately.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make something great!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Think about the last time at work you thought, or, better yet, said the words, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maybe you wrote some code that you were proud of, and you thought, &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;m good at my job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or maybe someone suggested you do a little more work that you wanted to, and you declined by saying, &ldquo;No thanks, I&rsquo;m good with what I&rsquo;m doing right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or maybe you lent a co-worker some cash and thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sadly, we probably don&rsquo;t acknowledge our good as often as we should. According to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/chairman/212045/world-broken-workplace.aspx">a Gallup's World Poll</a>, only 15% of the world&rsquo;s 1 billion full-time workers are engaged at work. In fact, Gallup even goes so far to say we&rsquo;re in an &ldquo;employee engagement crisis.&rdquo; I bet that statistic likely applies to the readers of this piece too: 85% of you are likely unengaged at your jobs, and you may not even know why.</p>


<h2>Project Aristotle</h2>

<p>In 2013, a team in Google&rsquo;s People Operations&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they call their &ldquo;human resources department&rdquo;&mdash;set out to determine what makes for effective teams at Google. Lead researcher Julia Rozovsky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html">reports her findings</a>, dubbed &ldquo;Project Aristotle.&rdquo; She says, &ldquo;We were pretty confident that we'd find the perfect mix of individual traits and skills necessary for a stellar team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead, they found that &ldquo;who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.&rdquo; And of all the factors involved, what was the one that emerged as the most important?</p>

<p><strong>Psychological safety.</strong></p>

<p>They found that individuals on teams with higher psychological safety are less likely to leave Google, they&rsquo;re more likely to harness the power of diverse ideas from their teammates, they bring in more revenue, and they&rsquo;re rated as effective twice as often by executives.</p>

<p>So, what can you do right away to start creating more safety within your teams? Perhaps you could encourage your team to kick off meetings by sharing a risk taken in the previous week. Make that part of the culture of how you get work done. If you&rsquo;re not a manager, talk to your manager about implementing something like this, and be willing to lead by example by being the first to share.</p>

<p>Some of you might be thinking, &ldquo;Yeah, that could work pretty well at my job.&rdquo; But I bet others of you are thinking, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way that would work for my teams. It&rsquo;s just so opposite of how we work right now.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s totally fair. For some, taking risks just isn&rsquo;t part of the culture of work; it&rsquo;s not part of your team&rsquo;s norms. Your boss tells you what to do you, and you do it, because there&rsquo;s likely some consequence waiting for you if you don&rsquo;t do it.</p>

<p>How do you turn that kind of situation around into a healthy one? You can start by establishing good boundaries.</p>


<h2>Boundaries</h2>

<p>If you own a house, everything inside the walls counts as part of your property. Your property also likely extends outside your house to your front yard and back yard. The boundary is clear. You get to decide who enters your property&mdash;your boundaries&mdash;and who doesn&rsquo;t. Your friends and family can likely come in, at your invitation. Strangers that threaten you cannot come in, and you may even call help like the police or a really strong friend to get them outside of your boundaries completely.</p>

<p>The same is true physically, mentally, and emotionally. You have boundaries that no one should cross unless you allow them to. Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to identify when someone crosses a boundary. If someone touches you without your permission, they&rsquo;re crossing your physical boundaries.</p>

<p>Others are more difficult to identify. When your parent guilt trips you into visiting to be a good son or daughter, they&rsquo;re crossing your emotional boundaries. Luckily, like building stronger or taller fences, we can practice strengthening our boundaries and there are great resources to help us do this.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/how-to-be-good-at-work/boundaries-coping2.png" alt="&ldquo;Boundaries,&rdquo; by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend and &ldquo;Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People&rdquo; by Nina Brown" />

<p>One of the my favorites is the aptly-titled <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2NEVvfi" title="Buy &ldquo;Boundaries&rdquo; on Amazon">Boundaries</a></cite> by psychologists Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend. In it are great nuggets like, &ldquo;Boundaries let the good in and keep the bad out.&rdquo; This book defines boundaries and gives examples&mdash;allegory-style&mdash;of how to put them into practice.</p>

<aside>

    <p>If you&rsquo;d prefer a variation that&rsquo;s specific to organizations as opposed to personal relationships, there&rsquo;s <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2p6cGbF" title="Buy &ldquo;Boundaries for Leaders&ldquo; on Amazon">Boundaries for Leaders</a></cite>, which offers practical advice on how to manage teams, coach direct reports, and instill an organization with strong values and culture.</p>

</aside>

<p>Another great resource is counselor Nina Brown&rsquo;s <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2NHiS7P" title="Buy &ldquo;Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People&rdquo; on Amazon">Coping with Infuriating, Mean, Critical People</a></cite>. She describes four types of boundaries:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Soft boundaries:</strong> when your boundaries merge with other people's. People with soft boundaries are easily victims of psychological manipulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Spongy boundaries:</strong> when you&rsquo;re unsure of what to let in and what to keep out.</li>
    <li><strong>Rigid boundaries:</strong> when you&rsquo;re closed or walled off so nobody can get close either physically or emotionally. Rigid boundaries are often the result of physical or emotional trauma.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible boundaries:</strong> when you decide what to let in and what to keep out. People with flexible boundaries are often resistant to emotional contagion and psychological manipulation and are difficult to exploit.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having flexible boundaries are what all of us can likely do better. Let&rsquo;s have a look at flexible boundaries in action.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdwQntqI-ts?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Quinta has excellent flexible boundaries. She decides what to let in and what to keep out. She was resistant to psychological manipulation. She was difficult to exploit.</p>

<p>For those that learn and practice boundaries for the first time, there&rsquo;s often a big initial reaction: <strong>but isn&rsquo;t that rude?</strong> Let&rsquo;s be clear: it&rsquo;s not rude. It&rsquo;s not rude to say no to someone. It&rsquo;s not rude to want something different than everyone else and stand up for it. Quinta wasn&rsquo;t obnoxious or off-putting; she was pleasant and accommodating, but she still made she sure that <em>she</em> was in control of what she wanted.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a complex concept in the Boundaries book: &ldquo;<strong>We are responsible <em>to</em> others and <em>for</em> ourselves.</strong>&rdquo; The corollary is that we are not responsible for others. The other two guys in this video were probably worried about hurting Justin&rsquo;s feelings. And that&rsquo;s where the complexity sneaks in: by making themselves responsible for Justin&rsquo;s feelings, by taking that on themselves, they&rsquo;re actually encroaching on Justin&rsquo;s boundaries in making assumptions on behalf of his emotions. They&rsquo;re probably well-intentioned, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that it&rsquo;s still a boundary violation.</p>

<p>One of the most common scenarios of unintentional boundary violations is in taking care of someone, for example, an aging parent or perhaps a relative or friend with a mental illness. The <a href="https://www.nami.org/">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a> has some <a href="https://www.nami.org/Find-Support/Family-Members-and-Caregivers/Maintaining-a-Healthy-Relationship">great tips on maintaining a relationship with someone with a mental illness</a> that, not surprisingly, include setting clear boundaries.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Tell your relative the standards you need him to meet so you can live well together. Make sure your loved one knows that you see him as a whole person, and that you expect him to follow those standards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We often think that mental illness means mental disorders, like schizophrenia or depression or dementia. And while these disorders are forms of mental illness, they&rsquo;re not always as evident. <abbr>NAMI</abbr> defines mental illness as &ldquo;a condition that affects a person's thinking, feeling, or mood.&rdquo; That condition could be stress. Or anger. Really, any one of us can experience conditions that affect our thinking and feelings at any time.</p>

<p>Essentially, setting clear boundaries is excellent way to maintain a healthy relationship with anyone. Strong boundaries are a prerequisite to creating <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/accountability/">accountability</a>.</p>

<h2>Accountability</h2>

<p>When now-Senator Corey Booker was mayor of Newark, <abbr title="New Jersey">NJ</abbr>, he helped realize unprecedented violent crime reduction and increased affordable housing in the city all while reducing the city budget deficit.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to hear him speak at <a href="https://brooklynbeta.org/2012/">Brooklyn Beta in 2012</a>. During the <abbr title="Question and Answer">Q&amp;A</abbr> session, someone asked how he and his team are able to achieve such incredible results. He responded by saying that they all hold each other accountable and proceeded to share his formula for accountability. There are 3 parts:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Stated standards</strong>. Having stated standards is the foundation of accountability. One can only be held accountable if both parties agree to the same standard.</li>
    <li><strong>A system of measurements.</strong> Both parties need to agree on a way to measure if they&rsquo;ve met said standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Effects: either positive, negative, or both.</strong> Both parties need to agree on what will happen after those standards are met and/or those standards are not met.</li>
</ol>

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re talking to your manager. You might say something like:</p> 

<blockquote><p>This functionality will be done by end of day today.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your manager may try to be more specific in order to make sure you have a defined standard. Maybe you could be more specific about what functionality. And what time is the end of the day? Midnight? Close of business?</p>

<blockquote><p><del>This functionality</del> <ins>The ability to upload a document</ins> will be done by <del>end of day</del> <ins>5pm Eastern</ins> today.</p></blockquote>

<p>This can easily be measured. Your manager may check the staging server at 5:01pm to test this functionality to see if it&rsquo;s working.</p>

<p>The last piece of creating accountability is that there must be effects, either positive or negative once those standards are measured. If that upload functionality works by 5:01pm, you get a promotion! But if it doesn&rsquo;t work&mdash;or worse: isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;by 5:01pm you get fired.</p>

<p>Ok, so that&rsquo;s a pretty extreme and unlikely example. Maybe this is more realistic. If that upload functionality works by 5:01pm, our client will probably sign more work with us. But if it doesn&rsquo;t work&mdash;or worse: isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;by 5:01pm, they probably won't renew the account.</p>

<p>If your teams aren&rsquo;t being productive, there&rsquo;s a chance it&rsquo;s because people aren&rsquo;t being held accountable. You can use this framework to help correct that; it&rsquo;s at least worth a shot.</p>

<p>Where I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of teams fall down is in the first piece: teams struggle to define standards well. Next time you&rsquo;re in a meeting and you hear someone punt on defining standards by trying to finish the conversation with something like, &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see how it turns out,&rdquo; speak up. You can say something like, &ldquo;Wait, can we try to define that a little more specifically so we know what we&rsquo;re accountable for?&rdquo; Little conversational cues like that can go a long way.</p>



<h2>Commit to commit</h2>

<p>Once everyone&rsquo;s on board with that idea, the next step is to create some commitments. Here&rsquo;s where boundaries come back into play. You want to create accountability without violating anyone&rsquo;s boundaries. A great way to d o that is to ask a closed-ended question, a question that you can only answer with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>

<aside>

    <p>It seems a bit counterintuitive: we tend to hear much more often about <a href="https://www.mediacollege.com/journalism/interviews/open-ended-questions.html">the value of open-ended questions</a> to stimulate deep conversation. But creating accountability is about the opposite. You&rsquo;re not looking to encourage conversation; instead, creating commitments are often about drawing conversations to a close.</p>

</aside>

<blockquote><p><strong>Can you</strong> finish the document upload functionality by 5pm today?&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The phrase &ldquo;can you&rdquo; allows the other person to make their own decisions. It respects their boundaries.</p>

<p>What if you&rsquo;re on the other end of this? What if your boss comes up to you and asks you this? That&rsquo;s not always a comfortable spot to be in.</p>

<p>There are two obvious ways to answer this: <strong>yes</strong> or <strong>no</strong>. But most people forget about a third and very powerful answer to this question.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not <strong>maybe</strong>. It&rsquo;s not <strong>I don&rsquo;t know</strong>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s to <strong>commit to commit</strong>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I can tell you by 3pm today.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is really powerful. What&rsquo;s your boss looking for? They just want to know what to expect. And you&rsquo;re letting them know that, very soon, they&rsquo;ll know what to expect.</p>

<aside>

    <p>I learned about this technique in a wonderful workshop with executive coach/consultant <a href="http://www.chalmersbrothers.com/about">Chalmers Brothers</a>. If you get an opportunity to attend any of his events, don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>

</aside>

<p>Once you get good at each of these three types of answers, you can start mixing and matching.</p>

<blockquote><p>No, but I can get to it by 6pm. Will that work for you?</p></blockquote>

<p>This is no longer just an interrogation about accountability; it&rsquo;s a conversation about it.</p> 

<p>Let&rsquo;s take what we&rsquo;ve learned so far and see if we can debunk one of the most used but most toxic strategies. </p>


<h2>Underpromise, overdeliver</h2>

<p>Do you use this technique? If you do, please stop. Please. It&rsquo;s awful and manipulative.</p>

<p>Why do I hate it so much? Well, it has another name that you might be familiar with.</p>

<p><strong>Lying</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how this works.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Me, at 3pm:</strong> Sorry, I won&rsquo;t have that upload functionality done by 5pm today.<br />
	<strong>Client:</strong> Ok, thanks for letting me know.<br />
	<strong>Me, at 5pm:</strong> Here&rsquo;s that upload functionality!<br />
	<strong>Client:</strong> Um ok. I thought we weren&rsquo;t gonna get this today. Cool&hellip; I guess?
</p>

<p>What happened here? Above all, I think people just want to know what to expect. They want to know that your word means something, that when you say you&rsquo;ll do it, you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>

<p>Now, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being wrong. If at 3pm, you don&rsquo;t think you can get something done but at 5pm you realize it was easier than you initially thought, that&rsquo;s great! But own it. Don&rsquo;t celebrate finishing early before you apologize for setting the wrong expectations. That way, your client will know that you value your word as much as they want to.</p>

<aside>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve seen lots of people use &ldquo;underpromise, overdeliver&rdquo; as a strategy. As in, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to promise in advance that we&rsquo;ll do less than we actually intend to, then we&rsquo;ll deliver more than they expect but we intended all along.&rdquo; This is dishonest. Stop it. All people will learn about you is that the words you say never match your deliveries. This is a terrible way to build trust.</p>

</aside>

<p>One of my philosophies about doing client work&mdash;and this applies equally if your client is instead a manager or another internal stakeholder&mdash;is to <strong>show clients the future</strong>. Let them know what&rsquo;s coming up.</p> 

<p>For every client, I set up a <a href="https://github.com/SuperFriendly/project-hub">Project Hub</a> on a new subdomain. It&rsquo;s a simple list of all of the upcoming milestones. As we go, it&rsquo;s ok if things shift, but we&rsquo;re always trying to reset expectations so the client always has an accurate view that&rsquo;s far out as we can confidently say.</p>



<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>One of the tough things about accountability is that you may run into someone that&rsquo;s honestly difficult to make accountable. Despite trying to establish standards, conceiving a great way to measure those, and having appropriate effects, nothing seems to be working. In that scenario, chances are pretty high that you&rsquo;re dealing with an unmotivated colleague or direct report.</p>

<p>Maybe that person is you, despite trying your best to drum up the interest to no avail.</p>

<p>I recently worked with a startup that asked me to coach their teams to level up their collaborative processes. In particular, they thought the designers&rsquo; work wasn&rsquo;t exactly up to snuff with what they could be producing, so they asked me to see what I could unearth. They don&rsquo;t have a head of design, so the head of engineering has been standing in as head of design to get the designers moving.</p>

<p>When I asked the head of engineering what the root of the problem might be, he said, &ldquo;Listen, we have to ship this product so we don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to explore. We have to execute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I asked the designers what the root of the problem might be, they said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just taking orders designing what everyone tells us to do.&rdquo;</p> 

<p>How do you fix this scenario?</p>

<p>In Daniel Pink&rsquo;s <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Qq9Sm9" title="Buy &ldquo;Drive&rdquo; on Amazon">Drive</a></cite>, he describes a framework for what drives people, what motivates them:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> the desire to direct our own lives.</li>
    <li><strong>Mastery:</strong> the urge to make progress and get better and something that matters to us.</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> the yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves.</li>
</ul>

<p>The designers had none of these three, so it wasn&rsquo;t surprising that they didn&rsquo;t feel driven or motivated. People were telling them what to design, so they had no autonomy; they couldn&rsquo;t direct their own lives. They were being managed by someone who didn&rsquo;t know their skills, so they had little idea for how to make progress. The startup is in financial services, a category the designers didn&rsquo;t have too much interest in, so there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of purpose in it for them either.</p>

<p>So, we tried to carve out some space for each designer to practice at least one of these. We did about 2 weeks worth of design work, so the engineers had their hands full for a while. Now that the designers had some free time, we looked for autonomous spaces for them to practice some mastery.</p>
<p>One of the designers wanted to explore how illustration could make the app warmer, so he spent the next 2 weeks compiling reference material, sketching, and having a ton of fun. The other designer wanted to tighten up their not-so-used component library with updated code samples and guidelines, so she went to town on that. Seeing how well it was going, the head of engineering committed to letting them keep some space where they got to rule their own domains. A few weeks later, the team is a well-oiled machine that&rsquo;s seeing much more involvement and fire from everyone.</p>



<h2>From selfish to selfless</h2>

<p>The things discussed above are techniques to cover your own butt. Creating accountability, making commitments, and finding motivation are all foundational to creating a culture of work where everyone&rsquo;s boundaries are respected. But that stuff just makes teams functional; it&rsquo;s not what makes things great. I&rsquo;ve heard <abbr title="Vice President">VP</abbr> of Design Education for InVision <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Aarron Walter</a> likes to say, &ldquo;No one settles for a meal that&rsquo;s edible. They want it to be delicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Teams where everyone is selfish are the making for dysfunction. That&rsquo;s probably not news to you. Most teams, though, end up with self-centered team members. People aren&rsquo;t selfish in a malicious way; it&rsquo;s just that everyone&rsquo;s looking out for themselves, because who else would?</p>

<p>We have to try to push our teams further. In order to create psychological safety, team members need to be looking out for each other more.</p>

<p><a href="https://startwithwhy.com/">Simon Sinek</a> is probably best known for <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/simon_sinek" title="Simon Sinek on TED">his TED talks</a> and his book <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2Okp4zU" title="Buy &ldquo;Start with Why&rdquo; on Amazon">Start with Why</a></cite>, but his book <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2NzLekz" title="Buy &ldquo;Leaders Eat Last&rdquo; on Amazon">Leaders Eat Last</a></cite> is my favorite. It gives so many great tips and examples for how teams can be better supporting each other.</p>

<p>In the book, Sinek tells the story of an employee at manufacturing company whose diabetic wife needed surgery. The employee couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose pay, so his fellow employees transferred their own paid vacation days so he could have more paid days off. The company had never done something like this before, and it was actually in clear violation of official company policy. But they made it happen anyway. It&rsquo;s a touching tale of how people band together to reduce each other&rsquo;s risk.</p>

<p>Sinek also tells the story of a tech company <a href="http://www.nextjump.com/">Next Jump</a>&rsquo;s Lifetime Employment Policy: once you get hired, you can never be fired (unless you actively worked to undermine your colleagues or do something illegal). If you perform poorly, you don&rsquo;t get fired; you get coached. <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> Charlie Kim thinks of taking care of his employees like raising kids. He says, &ldquo;Most people would never get rid of their kids in hard times, so how can we lay off our people under the same conditions?&rdquo;

<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple illustration of how are organizations currently work, but how they could be so much more.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qhU5JEd-XRo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2>What can I do for you today?</h2>

<p>My last tip: go around to each member of your team and ask them what you can do for them today. Don&rsquo;t take no for an answer (while still respecting their boundaries!). It could be work-related, like converting a database or naming all the layers in a Sketch file. Or it could be as small as making sure everyone has a fresh glass of water once an hour.</p>

<p>This is the kind of stuff that makes not only our workplaces good, but our neighborhoods, and cities, and countries too. This is the stuff you won&rsquo;t pick up in a coding bootcamp or in a Github repo, but it can make all the difference for <strong>how to be good at work</strong>.</p>

<p>
    For designers and developers, one thing stands high above r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, cover letters, and university degrees: the esteemed portfolio. A great portfolio can get you a high-paying, life-restoring job, even if you don’t have much or any schooling. The converse is also true: you may have many degrees and lots of experience listed on a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, but unless you can demonstrate it through a portfolio, that great job opportunity may still pass you by. 
</p>

<p>What makes for a good portfolio? In a sentence, <strong>a portfolio that has the highest likelihood of landing a job indicates you already have the skills to do what you&rsquo;ll be hired to do.</strong> Will you be expected to design inventive user interfaces for senior citizens? That&rsquo;s what should be in your portfolio. Is that potential job expecting that you&rsquo;ll build React apps using Redux and LotusNotes? Time to break out that &ldquo;Domino for Dummies&rdquo; book.</p> 

<p>Many designers and developers think of a portfolio as a simple way to collect the things they&rsquo;ve worked on over the last few years of their careers. While that might make your mama proud, it&rsquo;s a distraction from the fact that a portfolio has a job to do—namely, to get you a job.</p>

<aside>

    <p>If you do want to collect your work somewhere, call it a &ldquo;time capsule&rdquo; or &ldquo;archive.&rdquo; And while those might <strong>help</strong> to get you a job, there are much better ways to land your dream gig than by just putting a random smattering of work in a place.</p>

</aside>

<p>Therefore, the first step in crafting a great portfolio is identifying what job you&rsquo;re actually trying to get. Half of that is identifying the company you&rsquo;d like to work for; the other half is identifying the specific job you want at that company. Once you know those things, you can create a specific message that addresses why you&rsquo;d be a great fit for <em>that</em> job at <em>that</em> company.</p>

<p>You might already see the conundrum with that approach: even with the same title, every job is at least slightly different from company to company. A <a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/about/careers-list/?job_id=Senior-Product-Designer-464419">Senior Product Designer job at online medical care appointment booking service Zocdoc</a> is different than a <a href="https://www.plated.com/careers?gh_jid=1169776">Senior Product Designer job at meal kit service Plated</a>. There&rsquo;s certainly overlap in the details: both companies are in New York, involve interdisciplinary collaboration, and require facilitation as well as execution skills. But the big stuff couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Plated is looking for a designer to &ldquo;help them craft beautiful and engaging experiences that help people transform dinnertime.&rdquo; Zocdoc is looking for a designer to help create &ldquo;the next generation of patient and provider experiences to help us transform healthcare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How could one portfolio possibly communicate both messages clearly? There probably aren&rsquo;t many designers out there that already have the skills and experience to rethink meals <em>and</em> transform healthcare. Hiring managers know this. At best, a singular portfolio would probably only be able to abstract the messages to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at creating experiences.&rdquo; See how much more watered down that is? By generalizing, you put the onus on the person evaluating your portfolio to draw their own conceptual line between your experience and their needs. A good portfolio would do that work for them.</p>

<aside>

    <p>Remember, most managers don&rsquo;t have training in being managers. No one ever taught them <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/interviewing-designers/">how to interview designers</a> or developers. The easier you make their jobs&mdash;finding and landing qualified candidates&mdash;by presenting yourself as the person they&rsquo;ve been looking for, the better the outcome for you.</p>

</aside>

<p>Which brings us to this potentially unpopular guideline for portfolios: <strong>every job you apply for should have its own portfolio.</strong> That&rsquo;s right: if you&rsquo;re applying for 4 jobs, you should have 4 different portfolios. A great portfolio shows the hiring manager why you&rsquo;re perfect for <em>that</em> job, and perhaps that job <a href="/onlyness/">only</a>. That means it may be a bad fit if you tried to reuse the same portfolio for another another job without at least significant modifications.</p>

<p>Whenever I mention this Multiple Portfolio Strategy&trade; to designers and developers looking for new jobs, they scoff. It&rsquo;s difficult enough to create one portfolio; tripling or quadrupling that effort seems virtually impossible. But let&rsquo;s appropriately qualify expectations: you&rsquo;re looking for a hiring manager to agree to pay you tens&mdash;or even hundreds&mdash;of thousands of dollars a year, based on something you whip together in a weekend? A good portfolio is an <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/investments/">investment</a>: the larger initial loss you can take in terms of how much effort you can put it, the larger the potential for gain at the end of that process.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p class="dm-c-pullquote_text">How easily can I already see this person working here? A great portfolio answers that question as clearly possible before any in-person interviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite recent example of these guidelines in action is <a href="https://www.francineforspotify.com/">the site Francine Tamakloe put together to apply at Spotify</a>. This site speaks directly to the role music has played in her life. She uses Spotify&rsquo;s typographic style and gradient color palette. She frames her work style via song lyrics and embeds a Spotify player of each song nearby. I don&rsquo;t know the details, but <a href="https://twitter.com/tamakloeee">her Twitter bio</a> says she&rsquo;s now &ldquo;hustlin&rsquo; at Spotify,&rdquo; and I can imagine this site played a big part in that.</p>

<p>Imagine if she wanted to work at Apple too. A simple &ldquo;Find &amp; Replace&rdquo; from &ldquo;Spotify&rdquo; to &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t really do the trick. This is a &ldquo;go big or go home&rdquo; approach. So many designers and developers think of their portfolios as &ldquo;one size fits all,&rdquo; and then are baffled as to why they can&rsquo;t land any job, much less their dream one.</p>


<h2>A template for a great portfolio</h2>

<p>In evaluating potential candidates, many hiring managers have criteria that looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Does the candidate have the skills to succeed at this job?</strong> For example, can they already write Rails code for apps that millions of people use simultaneously? Or, can they take a concept from a whiteboard sketch to a polished interface design without much help from others?</li>
    <li><strong>Can the candidate prove that they have the skills to succeed at this job?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>If they don&rsquo;t already have the skills, how long would it take to learn them?</strong> Each organization has its own tolerance for this. Organizations under stakeholder and/or shareholder pressure may want you to get up to speed in a few weeks, while others may be willing to give you up to a year to get your bearings. Beware: this tolerance is rarely discussed internally or even acknowledged. It&rsquo;s often &ldquo;just a feeling&rdquo; that the hiring manager may have.</li>
    <li><strong>How well would the candidate fit in here?</strong> Are they like everyone else on the team? If not, is the difference one that will make everyone here better or make everyone here feel awkward?</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the specific criteria will likely vary, it can often be summarized like this: <strong>how easily can I already see this person working here?</strong> A great portfolio answers that question as clearly as possible <em>before</em> any in-person interviews.</p>

<p>What could that portfolio look like?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I wanted to apply for this <a href="https://jobs.nike.com/job/beaverton/senior-designer-north-america-retail-experience-design/824/9118910">Senior Designer, North America Retail Experience Design position</a> at Nike. First, I&rsquo;d find the person or people who may be reviewing this, and I&rsquo;d address it to them. For this job, I might address it to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/otake/">Junichi Otake</a>, Experience Design Director Retail Innovation at Nike. I don&rsquo;t know him personally, but I have 50 mutual connections with him on LinkedIn, so perhaps I could have someone who knows us both introduce us.</p>

<p>As far as the content of that portfolio goes, here&rsquo;s a rough wireframe of what that might be on there:</p>

<img src="http://danmall.com/articles/portfolios/portfolio-template.svg" alt="A portfolio template" />

<p>The important bits:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>An opening statement,</strong> addressed to a particular person, introducing myself and stating clearly why I&rsquo;d be a great fit for the position.</li>
    <li><strong>A collection of my work,</strong> specifically tailored to speak to this particular job description. For example, this job description uses specific phrases like &ldquo;product presentation&ldquo; and &ldquo;retail business targets,&rdquo; so I used those same phrases in talking about my work.</li>
    <li><strong>Something special about me</strong> professionally or personally that sets me above everyone else applying for this job. I&rsquo;m not just another designer; I&rsquo;m a designer that&rsquo;s also a sneakerhead.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember: this is a love letter to your dream job, so pour as much of yourself into it as you can! As you can probably tell, I used the most vanilla layout I could for this example, but the finished version is another opportunity to show you&rsquo;re right for the company. Bonus points for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using the same/similar typefaces and color scheme as the company</li>
    <li>Referencing some extra research you did, like info from a podcast or a trade magazine</li>
    <li>Pictures of you attending that company&rsquo;s events, evidence of you being a longtime customer, or other things that may distinguish you from other candidates</li>
</ul>

<p>The intention here is to answer some of the questions the hiring manager might have before they even ask it. For example, they may think, &ldquo;How would Dan would handle working on Nike+, which has both digital and physical components?&ldquo; I answer that&mdash;in advance, in my portfolio, before they actually ask me&mdash;in my portfolio piece for Crayola, which has both digital and physical components. They might wonder, &ldquo;Would Dan work well on a large team like ours?&rdquo; Which I answer in portfolio pieces about working with different team sizes. They might be curious as to whether or not I&rsquo;d even like working there, to which my sneaker fetish callouts would answer that it&rsquo;d be a slice of heaven for me. You get the idea.</p>

<h2>Reframing portfolios (even if only in your own mind)</h2>

<p>(<em>Note: this section was added September 7, 2018, five days after the article&rsquo;s initial publishing.</em>)</p>

<p>In response to this article, design Fedor Shkliarau <a href="https://twitter.com/shkliarau/status/1037003567608066048" title="A Twitter conversation between Fedor Shkliarau and Dan Mall">pointed out</a> that this may be more of a cover letter than a portfolio . Through that discussion, we arrived at the best term for something like this is <strong>a proposal</strong>. After I <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/prequalifying-clients/">prequalify clients</a> for <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a> projects, I&rsquo;ll often put together a collection&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s a short email of links or a 100-page, beautifully-designed <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>&mdash;of past work that&rsquo;s contextualized to the particular problem they&rsquo;re asking us to help them solve.</p>

<aside>

    <p>For the pedants among us, you&rsquo;re right that the definition of &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; is literally &ldquo;a collection of past work, used to demonstrate ability.&rdquo; However, for designers and developers, the connotation of the word has been elevated to often be the sole determinant in whether or not one is awarded a job. Though I believe we could use a new word to represent this idea, &ldquo;portfolio&rdquo; is the word our industry currently uses, so it seems more pragmatic in the short-term to clarify its intent as opposed to getting people to change what word they use.</p>

</aside>

<p>A good portfolio is no different. In fact, it may even be easier to put together than a services inquiry. With a services inquiry, I sometimes know very little about the company, and all I have to rely on for my response is a short conversation I may have had with a client. With a portfolio for an agency, you have all of their past work to look at to determine what&rsquo;s important to them. With a portfolio for a startup or product shop, you can look at the product(s) they make to understand what kind of company they are. For both, you can also research some of the people who work there to find out what qualities and skills they posses that landed them their jobs.</p>

<p>Thinking of this as a proposal instead of a portfolio can justify why it should be custom every time and help free you from the standard thinking that they way to get a job is to send a link to your online junk drawer or past projects.</p>

<p>While none of this is a plug-and-play template, I hope this gives you a starting point for how to spruce up your <del>portfolio</del> <ins>proposal</ins> to say the appropriate things in appropriate ways to the people you want to hire you. Happy job hunting!</p>

<p>The way designers and developers work together today is broken. It&rsquo;s too siloed and separate; &ldquo;collaboration&rdquo; is a fantasy that few enjoy.</p>

<p>The state of advertising in the 1940s was similar. The all-powerful copywriter took what the clients wanted to say&mdash;usually simply the features of their product&mdash;and turned it into a headline and body copy. Then, they&rsquo;d hand that copy to an account executive who would run it to another floor and literally slide that paper under a door to the art department to &ldquo;visualize&rdquo; the final ad. Artists simply followed the copywriter&rsquo;s orders. It was very rare that the copywriter and the artist would actually know each other.</p>

<p>All of that changed when copywriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bernbach">Bill Bernbach</a> met art director <a href="http://www.paul-rand.com/">Paul Rand</a>. Rand once remarked about working with Bernbach, &ldquo;This was my first encounter with a copywriter who understood visual ideas and who didn&rsquo;t come in with a yellow copy pad and a preconceived notion of what the layout should look like.&rdquo; Contrary to the siloed dynamic at the time, they&rsquo;d take lunch breaks together to visit art museums and galleries; they became good friends.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/designer-developer-workflow/vw.jpg" alt="" />
	<figcaption>The famous Volkswagen ads created at DDB under Berbach&rsquo;s direction</figcaption>
<figure>
   
<p>Their collaborative working style led to the birth of the idea of &ldquo;the creative team,&rdquo; the mutual respect and partnership between art director and copywriter that tended to yield unique results. Bob Gage, an art director that worked for <a href="http://www.ddb.com/">DDB</a>, the agency Bernbach co-founded, described it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Two people who respect each other sit in the same room for a length of time and arrive at a state of&hellip; free association, where the mention of one idea will lead to another idea, then to another. The art director might suggest a headline, the writer a visual. The entire ad is conceived as a whole, in a kind of ping pong between disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what we all strive for in our jobs True collaboration with equals and partners? Ideas that build off one another? Why does this seem so far away for some of us?</p> 

<h2>A new workflow in action</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to work fairly often with my good friend <a href="http://bradfrost.com/">Brad Frost</a>, and one of the things I love most about working with him is that we both actively pursue that ping pong momentum within our collective work.</p>

<p>Brad and I both do our fair share of workshops with designers and developers that would love to have a more collaborative dynamic with their co-workers. While they&rsquo;re all typically on-board with the theory of collaborating more, they also seemed a bit stumped as to what that actually looks like from minute to minute.</p>

<p>So, Brad and I decided to record an almost-two-hour-long video of us working together:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnkrUt7PpnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that we cover in here, and we barely scratch the surface. Here&rsquo;s a quick list of concepts we cover in this walkthrough:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Working quickly and roughly with <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/">element collages</a></li>
    <li>The importance of <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-workshop-and-the-storefront/">workshop and storefront</a> environments</li>
    <li><a href="/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/">Stealing from and remixing</a> existing interfaces to create something original</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/your-sketch-library-is-not-a-design-system-redux/">folly of relying too heavily on static design tools</a></li>
    <li>A reminder that <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/development-is-design/">development is design</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And lots more! In fact, we barely even finish the page we&rsquo;re working on, mostly because we&rsquo;re talking through what we&rsquo;re doing rather than solely doing the work. If there&rsquo;s enough interest, we may do a few more of these so you can see it all come to fruition.</p>

<p>For more info, please check out Brad&rsquo;s thoughts about all of this in his post, <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/designer-developer-workflow">Designer + Developer Workflow</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d love to hear any feedback you might have about all this. Is this a new kind of workflow for you? Is this how you&rsquo;ve worked for years? Interested in working this way at your company but not sure where to start? Let us know what questions you have, and thanks for reading and watching!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Over a year ago, Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Magazine asked me if I&rsquo;d be game to do a conference talk without slides, something more about showing work in action.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/smashing-conference-toronto-2018/smashing-live.png" alt="The initial message from Vitaly Friedman about a &ldquo;no slides&rdquo; conference" />

<p>I was immediately excited to do it, as I could immediately think of how I&rsquo;d do that, since I do that almost daily with <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">my apprentices</a>. (I previously wrote down the details of that framework in <a href="/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/">Stealing Your Way to Original Designs</a>.)</p>

<p>I normally don&rsquo;t stress too much about talks nowadays as I&rsquo;ve given <a href="/speaking-podcasts/">my fair share</a> of them, but this one was a bit different. Trying to do final prep the night before was difficult, because I didn&rsquo;t have slides to review. Also, because of the format of the talk, I didn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to prep extensively. Too much prep might dilute the whole concept of showing how I make decisions while designing.</p>

<p>So I decided the best prep would probably to get the best night&rsquo;s sleep I could get.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I gave that talk.</p>

<p>I planned to redesign the <abbr title="Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services"><a href="https://www.raicestexas.org/">RAICES</a></abbr> site on stage. In my rough rehearsals, I designed a fair bit of the site. On stage, all I got to was buttons. 😶</p>

<p>I walked off stage uneasy about the talk, and felt uneasy about it all day. One thing I&rsquo;m most proud of is my talks is feeling like like share <em>a lot</em>. With this one, I don&rsquo;t think I shared enough. The feedback I got from attendees was all nice, but I also know that people who hated it probably wouldn&rsquo;t come up to me to say so.</p>

<p>After sleeping on it though, now I feel great about the talk. Two pieces of feedback I got that stand out:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A few designers felt validated in their processes by seeing mine.</li>
    <li>A few developers said design felt less intimidating now, both to understand as well as to try.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a speaker, that&rsquo;s more than a great outcome. Upon reflection, getting an outcome like that without spending weeks and months laboring over crafting the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; narrative for just the right sequence and quantity of slides is wonderful!</p>

<p>I tend to view my talks as a performance. And I think there&rsquo;s merit to that. But I hadn&rsquo;t considered much that there&rsquo;s another format that can achieve similar outcomes. In the language of <a href="https://twitter.com/blairenns">Blair Enns</a>&rsquo; <cite><a href="https://amzn.to/2N0eiyi">Win Without Pitching Manifesto</a></cite>, I could &ldquo;replace presentations with conversations.&rdquo; I do that almost completely in client work but not for conferences.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect this, but I&rsquo;m now seriously considering this format as a way I do talks at other conferences. (I&rsquo;d love feedback about that from other conference organizers, if you have opinions.)</p>

<p>All this is to say: thanks to Vitaly and the Smashing Magazine and Smashing Conference crew for challenging the typical format. I learned a lot about how I can be a better speaker.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Do we have too many design systems?</p>

<p>Clearly, I&rsquo;m biased: most of <a href="http://superfriend.ly/">SuperFriendly</a>&rsquo;s work nowadays involves either creating a design system or modifying one as part of a larger effort for a client. But why even go through any of that effort in the first place?</p>

<p>When I started <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/researching-design-systems/">researching design systems</a> for <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/unity-design-system-exxonmobil.html">Unity</a>, the design system we made for ExxonMobil, my biggest observation was that the digital design systems out at the time were extremely generic. There&rsquo;s a lot of benefit to that: part of the job of a design system is to <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html">take care of the boring stuff</a> to free you up to tackle the more exciting and challenging bits, so some amount of convention is expected and encouraged. That genericness is what allows designers and developers to create quickly, not to overthink our interfaces and unnecessarily reinvent the wheel. It&rsquo;s no surprise that <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is as popular as it is: you can build something significant with even a basic understanding of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> without a lot of fuss. And <a href="https://www.uplabs.com/search?q=material">a quick search on UpLabs</a> shows how much can be done with Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, we need better tools. In fact, a lot of our design system work has used &ldquo;better than Bootstrap&rdquo; or &ldquo;more meaningful than Material&rdquo; as a creative brief or rallying cry of sorts. But what does it mean to be better? Every client I work with has at least one problem or challenge that Bootstrap or Material Design didn&rsquo;t anticipate. That&rsquo;s not to disparage those tools; it was never their job to do in the first place. This is where a distinct design system can be helpful: to solve your organization&rsquo;s unique problems in a way a generic tool isn&rsquo;t designed to help with.</p>

<h2>Relying on Principles</h2>

<p>Web developer and author <a href="https://twitter.com/adactio">Jeremy Keith</a> shares <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/13844">some great wisdom</a> about design systems:</p>

<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s not very useful to create a library of patterns without providing any framework for using those patterns.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Often times, that framework comes in the form of principles, which is likely why most design systems have them. Design Principles <abbr>FTW</abbr> <a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/what-are-design-principles">describes two types of principles</a>: universal and specific. The problem is that most design systems stop at universal principles. For example, <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/design-principles/">SAP Fiori&rsquo;s design principles</a> are all universal. While &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; and &ldquo;simple&rdquo; apply to Fiori, they also apply to, well, every other design system too. I&rsquo;m not implying malice or ignorance here; I think that&rsquo;s a result of 1) the difficulty of writing great, specific principles and 2) the fact that having only universal principles are better than having nothing at all.</p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/2004/12/the_pvrblog_int.html">TiVo has specific design principles</a> like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&rsquo;s entertainment, stupid.</li>
	<li>It&rsquo;s <abbr>TV</abbr>, stupid.</li>
	<li>It&rsquo;s video, dammit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Very brand! Such tone! Those wouldn&rsquo;t work for a car manufacturer or a tech company. Specific design principles should fit your organization perfectly and look awkward on everyone else.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see every design system strive for an <a href="/articles/onlyness/">only-ness</a>, some unique angle or aspect that other design systems don&rsquo;t cater to. Your product or organization probably has a specific perspective on the problem it&rsquo;s trying to solve in the world; your design system should reflect, refract, and reverberate that position. (If your organization <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have that differentiation, you&rsquo;ve got some foundational identity work to do.)</p>

<p>That only-ness doesn&rsquo;t have only to be principle-driven; it could come directly from the mission of your company. In Vox Media senior design director <a href="https://twitter.com/yeseniaa">Yesenia Perez-Cruz</a>&rsquo;s talk, <cite><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/yeseniaperezcruz/building-flexible-design-systems?slide=17">Building Flexible Design Systems</a></cite>, she nails what Vox&rsquo;s design system is built for: telling better stories, faster. That clear purpose drives what components they need, what scenarios to design for, and what they can work toward together.</p>

<h2>Reverse-engineering principles from components</h2>

<p>One workflow tip I&rsquo;ve tried to put to good use is that you don&rsquo;t have to define principles before you create components; it&rsquo;s not a one-way street. Many times, you can derive your principles from how the work gets done. Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/markboulton">Mark Boulton</a> shares <a href="https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/defining-design-principles-at-embl">his experience with this flexibility around design principles</a>:</p>          

<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a team can quickly pull together principles that are derived from doing the work on their particular problem rather than principles which are imposed on the work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A team can do this because the general public can too. Here&rsquo;s a quick inventory of a handful of design systems and the components they contain:</p>

<p>By looking across components in aggregate, we can very clearly see what the boring stuff is, because most of these design systems have them. That&rsquo;s stuff like buttons and form elements, as just about all of these design systems seem to contain them.</p>

<p>More interesting, however, are the components that only appear in one of these design systems. (Ignore the ones that look isolated but are actually just a result of non-standard taxonomies for components.) They start to give you a clue as to the unique value proposition of each design system. For example, FutureLearn&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/pattern-library/molecules/quiz-progress-nav">Quiz Progress Nav</a> only seems appropriate in environments where one is being tested online, which already starts to give you a clue as to what FutureLearn does. </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thoughtwax">Emmet Connolly</a>, director of product design for <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a>, calls this <a href="https://blog.intercom.com/the-full-stack-design-system/">a full stack design system</a>. He suggests building everything around the core objects of your brand or organization. Here are some examples of what that might be for some well-known companies:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Facebook:</strong> Friend, Post, Message, Event, Page, Group.</li>
	<li><strong>Airbnb:</strong> Listing, Host, Guest, Trip, Experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Slack:</strong> Team, Member, Channel, Message, Reaction, Thread.</li>
	<li><strong>Intercom:</strong> Customer, Teammate, Message, Conversation, Article.</li>
</ul>

<p>By focusing on this kind of specificity, I think we&rsquo;ll see a lot more innovative and interesting design systems pop up in the near future. I sure hope so!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.me/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Creating an Only-ness Statement is one of my favorite exercises to do with new clients. I first came across it in my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jpostendorf">J&auml;n Paul Ostendorf</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://amzn.to/2NAUGB6">Brand Formation Workbook</a>, who found it in <a href="http://www.martyneumeier.com/">Marty Neumeier</a>&rsquo;s book <a href="https://amzn.to/2HGJIej">Zag</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple premise: every brand on the planet should be able to say what it&rsquo;s the only one of. Marty suggests this simple format:</p>

<p>
    What:<br />
    How:<br />
    Who:<br />
    Where:<br />
    Why:<br />
    When:<br />
</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Harley-Davidson is:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>What</td>
        <td>The only motorcycle manufacturer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>How</td>
        <td>that makes big, loud motorcycles</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Who</td>
        <td>for macho guys (and macho wannabes)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Where</td>
        <td>mostly in the United States</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Why</td>
        <td>who want to join a gang of cowboys </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>When</td>
        <td>in an era of decreasing personal freedom.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>A great test of the only-ness statement is to put a competitor&rsquo;s name in place and see if it still fits. Slotting in Triumph Motorcycles or Suzuki or Yamaha makes this statement awkward at best and inaccurate at worst; therefore, it&rsquo;s a worthy statement for Harley-Davidson.</p>

<p>Jan suggests a slightly different framing&mdash;a sort-of mad libs style&mdash;which I find a little easier to use:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the only <input type="text" placeholder="Type of digital experience" /> that <input type="text" placeholder="Unique service or product you provide" /> for <input type="text" placeholder="Target audience" /> in <input type="text" placeholder="Geographic region or market segment" /> who want to <input type="text" placeholder="Customer&rsquo;s emotional motivation" /> during a time of <input type="text" placeholder="Increasing or decreasing cultural trend" />.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll often use this exercise in workshops with large groups. The format is similar to a <a href="http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/2010/04/design-studioprototyping-exercise/">design studio</a> setup. I&rsquo;ll start by giving each person 2 worksheets to fill out over 8 minutes. Once the 8 minutes are up, I&rsquo;ll pair people together and ask them to create one worksheet between the two of them. That could mean using whichever one version is best, or maybe the pair creates a brand new one with the best of each of their ideas. Groups of two get combined into groups of four people, then eight&hellip; you get the idea. The ultimate output is two or three versions that conceivably reflect the best or most rallying ideas in the room. For example, <a href="https://bigmedium.com/projects/about-verywell-thebalance.html">when we worked with Dotdash</a> to create new home and lifestyle site <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/">The Spruce</a>, here were the three final only-ness statements that we used to drive our <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/on-creative-direction/">creative direction</a> for the whole project:</p>

<blockquote><p>This is the only <strong>home and food website</strong> that <strong>simplifies and empowers DIYers and aspiring superheroes</strong> who want to <strong>conquer their to-do list and feel proud</strong> during a time of <strong>perceived and unachievable perfection</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This is the only <strong>immersive home life site</strong> that <strong>gives you what you came for and more</strong> for <strong>people like you</strong> who want to <strong>feel good about what you come home</strong> to during a time of <strong>increasing choice and decreasing bandwidth</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>This is the only <strong>lifestyle brand</strong> that <strong>gives practical, real-world advice and ideas</strong> for <strong>the roll-up-your-sleeves crowd and those looking for inspiration</strong> who want to <strong>reinvigorate their home life with small victories</strong> during a time when <strong>food and home trends feel unattainable.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>You can simultaneously see different themes emerging in each, but there are also more than a few common threads among them too. This type of clarity and insight can lead to unique strategy for any brand.</p>

<p>Next time you start work with a new client&mdash;or heck, maybe you use your own business or employer as a test&mdash;feel free to give this a shot to see if it gives you a new perspective. Good luck!</p>

<p><span class="dm-dp-openingLines">After four days</span> of working together, she finally admitted, &ldquo;No one ever taught me how to scope.&rdquo; I was working with one of my clients&rsquo; senior developers to map out exactly how we were going to get all of the work done that we needed, but a few frustrating hours of going in circles finally revealed the culprit. It&rsquo;s a problem I&rsquo;ve seen from very junior to some of the most senior employees I&rsquo;ve worked with.</p>

<p>Simply put, I like to define <dfn>scope</dfn> as:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A description of all the work that needs to get done, and</li>
    <li>The time needed to do said work.</li> 
</ol>

<p>That can be as simple as building a website in 5 days or as complex as organizing an entire ad campaign. Regardless, the formula remains intact.</p>

<p>Good scoping is often a case of simple arithmetic; by the time you were 8 or 9 years old, you&rsquo;ve had the skills to scope well. So why is it so difficult? You&rsquo;re mostly fighting the psychology of it all.</p>

<p>If I asked you if you could build a website (of any given complexity) in 6 months, I&rsquo;d bet your answer would be, &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_effect">valence effect</a> at play: your tendency to think that more good will happen to you than bad. Throw a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson&rsquo;s law</a> in there (the adage that work expands to fill the time available for its completion) and that explains why you&rsquo;ve taken way longer on every project than you should have&mdash;and felt good about it to boot. The reality is closer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law">Hofstadter&rsquo;s law</a>: it always takes longer than you expect (even when you take into account Hofstadter&rsquo;s law). Rather than relying on gut feelings, we can use math to figure out if you&rsquo;ll meet your deadlines.</p>

<h2>Budgeting time</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like most people (and like me), it&rsquo;s difficult to save money. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re trying to save $6,000 for a vacation next year. That&rsquo;s a daunting task at first glance, but it becomes easier when you break it down. Instead of looking at it as $6k, look at it as $500/month ($6,000 &divide; 12 months). Or maybe it&rsquo;s $125/week ($500 &divide; 4 weeks). Or $25/day ($125 &divide; 5 days). When you look at it that way, for every day you go to work, skip your Starbucks coffee, pack a lunch, throw that $25 in a jar, and watch that vacation happen in no time. By breaking it down into digestible chunks, it&rsquo;s much more manageable!</p>

<p>If it helps, think of scoping like a budget for your time.</p>

<h2>Building a website in 5 days</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take the simple example from earlier: building a website in 5 days. If it&rsquo;s a 5-page website, our basic math skills (5 pages &divide; 5 days) tell us that we need to average building about 1 page per day. So far, our workload would look like this:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col">Workload</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Monday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Tuesday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Wednesday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Thursday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th scope="row" >Friday</th>
            <td >1 page</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>But we can break that down even further, because building a page has three components to it: <abbr title="HyperText Marktup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript. So, let&rsquo;s divide a typical 9am&ndash;5pm workday into four parts (because lunch is incredibly important too, kids):</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Monday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Tuesday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Wednesday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>

            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Thursday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >Lunch</td>
            <td >1:00pm&ndash;2:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >JavaScript</td>
            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="5" scope="row" >Friday</th>
            <td colspan="2" >Page 5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >HTML</td>
            <td >9:00am&ndash;11:00am</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td >CSS</td>
            <td >11:00am&ndash;1:00pm</td>

            <td >2:00pm&ndash;5:00pm</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is much better! The specificity here can help to assess if this is a realistic plan. But we can break it down even further.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say the first page has 4 different sections. We can average the time to write the markup for each section, for example:</p>

<table>

<p>You can continue to break down each task further if it&rsquo;s useful to do so, but, even at this level, you can realistically assess the work. Can you write a section of <abbr>HTML</abbr> in 30 minutes? If yes, great! You&rsquo;re on schedule and will make your timeline. If not, what can you adjust or reorder to make it work?</p>

<p>Herein lies the real beauty of this technique: <strong>you&rsquo;ll know when you&rsquo;re in danger of missing a deadline days, weeks, or even months in advance.</strong> For example, if you haven&rsquo;t completed Section 3 of Page 1&rsquo;s <abbr>HTML</abbr> by Monday at 10:30am, you&rsquo;re going to miss your deadline. Sure, it&rsquo;s possible that you may make up the time later on, but if you&rsquo;ve estimated realistically and remember Hofstadter&rsquo;s law, now&mdash;4 days in advance&mdash;is a good time to ask your client or manager for an extra day, just in case.</p>

<p>Scoping is about appropriately setting expectations for yourself, your team, and your clients and managers. It&rsquo;s a rare skill that separates the amateurs from the professionals. Which one are you?</p>

<p>I have a framework that I find very helpful in teaching <a href="http://superfriend.ly/academy/">my apprentices</a> how to design. It&rsquo;s 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="#imitate">Imitate</a></li>
    <li><a href="#remix">Remix</a></li>
    <li><a href="#invent">Invent</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the details.</p>

<h2>1. Imitate</h2>

<p>The first step to being just a competent designer—or a competent anything, for that matter—is doing what someone else can do. It&rsquo;s a test: can you follow directions? Except, instead of following directions you read or hear, you follow directions that you see. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that junior designers often get trained up by doing production work after an art director has set an art direction. If the art director makes the main headline 48px bold Helvetica with 16px of margin on each side, do you do the same on every screen you design? Sounds simple, but many junior designers struggle to even get this down. Why? Many want to be chefs but aren&rsquo;t willing to be line cooks first. It&rsquo;s not glamorous work, but it builds design muscles, muscles that you&rsquo;ll need in order to get better and advance to the next step. </p>

<p>Think of it like learning to draw by tracing. In fact, it’s literally the same thing. The first few assignments of my designers&rsquo; apprenticeships are taking screenshots of existing websites, pasting them into Sketch or Photoshop, dropping the opacity and locking the layer, and tracing over it to produce the same layout, colors, illustrations, typography, and everything else needed to reproduce the site pixel for pixel.</p>

<p>In his article <cite><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/02/improving-ui-design-skills-copywork/">Copy If You Can: Improving Your UI Design Skills With Copywork</a></cite>, Erik Kennedy extols the virtues of copywork as a great way to practice and hone <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> design skills. Even more, it gets you out of going to your usual bag of tricks and instead gives you new ones to add.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Done right, copywork exposes you to design decisions you simply wouldn&rsquo;t have made on your own.</p>
    <address>Erik Kennedy</address>
</blockquote> 


<p>Whether new to design or a seasoned creative director, this simple exercise will get you warmed up, like stretching before a long run.</p>

<h2>2. Remix</h2>

<p>Once you can confidently imitate any style you come across, you can start to tweak the elements to feel more custom to the way you need to use it. This step has the least parameters and needs the least guidelines, because it&rsquo;s up to your imagination and the amount of changes you&rsquo;re willing to try.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in the idea that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%201:9">there&rsquo;s nothing new under the sun</a>. Said differently, <a href="http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/">everything is a remix</a>. Freed from the pressure that all things designers do need to be original works of art, I can instead focus my efforts on what sources to combine in a unique way that my audience is less accustomed to.</p>

<h2>3: Invent</h2>

<p>Pablo Picasso is well known for his original Cubist work, but most people don&rsquo;t know that he was an excellent classical artist first. He could draw and paint photorealism as well as any of the great masters, but it wasn&rsquo;t until he got that down that he ventured into his own unknown stylistic territory.</p>

<p>In his Wall Street Journal article, <cite><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703989304575503730101860838">The Genius of the Tinkerer</a></cite>, author Steven Johnson describes a concept he calls <em>the adjacent possible</em>. He tells the story of a young orthopedic surgeon who, while diving in the Great Barrier Reef, observes a species of coral that seem to be able to heal itself as it breaks. Years later, while operating on a patient, he recalls this coral and its amazing bonding powers. Several years and patents later, his method is the leading way that orthopedic surgeons around the world help their patients mend their broken bones.</p>

<p>The adjacent possible is about taking two seemingly unconnected ideas and metaphorically placing them next to each other to see how they might work together. Clients often hire me to invent unique and original art directions for them. I can deliver on this by using the adjacent possible to steal my way to something original.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The strange and beautiful truth about the adjacent possible is that its boundaries grow as you explore them. Each new combination opens up the possibility of other new combinations.</p>
    <address>Steven Johnson</address>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at how this works in practice. </p>

<p>Say SpaceZzzz&trade; hired me to create a site to advertise a new service they&rsquo;re offering: rental properties on different planets. They&rsquo;d get you there, you stay as long as you&rsquo;d like, and they&rsquo;ll get you back. Think <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> meets <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> meets <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/">Interstellar</a>. </p>

<p>The first thing I&rsquo;ll do is make a list of all of the types of content I&rsquo;ll need on the homepage. After talking to stakeholders and potential users in the target market, perhaps I&rsquo;d arrive at 5 different sections:</p>

<ol>
    <li>An elevator pitch about the new service </li>
    <li>A featured destination (or a few features)</li>
    <li>Some details about what people may be anxious about, like long travel or planetary accommodations </li>
    <li>Price </li>
    <li>Contact details </li>
</ol>

<p>To start, I&rsquo;ll block out these main sections with a few <a href="http://v3.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2004/05/24/grey_box_method.php">gray boxes</a>.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/gray-boxes.png" alt="Gray boxes for page sections" />

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll start to choose a few reference sources to imitate. This is key:  be sure to choose sources far away from what you&rsquo;re designing. If you&rsquo;re designing a bank site, don&rsquo;t choose another bank site as reference, especially within the same competitive set. Since we may be modeling this after Airbnb, using Airbnb as a reference is probably too close to feel original. One trick I often use is to start smaller. Rather than try to use a whole page as a reference, I&rsquo;ll pick a few different designs to source different elements from.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll stub out each section by simply copying and pasting from my source material into my gray box document. (I&rsquo;m using Photoshop for this example because it&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m fastest, but you can use any design app you prefer.) This sets me up with something to imitate and remix.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/stub.png" alt="Stubbing out sections using sample" />

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/witness.jpg" alt="" />

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll trace over my stubbed-out version with simple shapes to get a feel for how it could work together. I&rsquo;ll also start to remix a bit by choosing some new colors. I own this Nike Witness shirt and thought these colors would work well for this subject matter.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/blocked-out.png" alt="Tracing over stubbed-out version" />

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll fill in some text content by tracing over the text of the original stubs, but trying to unify them by remixing them with the same typeface. I decide on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans">PT Sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono">PT Mono</a> and use this stage to start working out some sizing of headlines and body copy to rough out my typographic hierarchy.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/filled-in.png" alt="Filling in text content" />

<p>Now that I have a good approximation of all my content, I&rsquo;ll start to draw a grid so I can organize that content appropriately. My approach to grids has always been to <a href="http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/a-richer-canvas">start with content</a> and use the least amount of columns possible. Looking at the Locations section, that&rsquo;s a pretty good candidate for 4 equal-width columns, so I&rsquo;ll start there.</p>

<p>However, as I look at the top hero and <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> areas, I realize that some of those headings need to start in the middle of a column, so I&rsquo;ll split the 4-column grid into 8 columns instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written about using an <a href="https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid">8-point grid</a> <a href="/articles/cooking-with-design-systems/">before</a>&mdash;which I&rsquo;m using increasingly more in my own work&mdash;so all my spacings and type sizes here are a multiple of 8.</p>

<figure>
    <a href="grid4.png"><img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/grid4.png" alt="" /></a>

    <figcaption>An 8-column grid</figcaption>
</figure>        


<p>That 8-column grid is looking pretty good everywhere except for the Pricing table. That section contains 5 specific areas:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Features</li>
    <li>Basic</li>
    <li>Pro</li>
    <li>Teams</li>
    <li>Corporate</li>
</ol>

<p>5 sections over 8 columns doesn&rsquo;t divide evenly, so I&rsquo;ll need another split. By subdividing into 16 columns, that&rsquo;ll let me do a 4-column feature listing and 3 columns for each of the plans. 16 columns it is.</p>

    <a href="grid16.png"><img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/grid16.png" alt="" /></a>

    <figcaption>All content realigned to the new 16-column grid</figcaption>
</figure>        

<p>I&rsquo;m ready to start inserting more of my content into this shell, specifically my own copy and artwork. The key to stealing in a way that leads to something original is that your result needs to be unrecognizable from the source material as much as possible. Take the hero unit for example.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero1.png" alt="Hero unit" />

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to compare this to the original source and tell where it came from. Flipping the orientation of elements is a really useful way to to get around that. Let&rsquo;s move the main headline and the call to action to the opposite side of the screen.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero2-flip.png" alt="Hero unit flipped" />

<p>Let&rsquo;s add our own artwork.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero3-artwork.png" alt="Hero unit with artwork" />

<p>The artwork goes a long way into making this feel original, but there&rsquo;s still one more thing we need to do. That notched-out call to action is such a unique piece that it&rsquo;s become signature to the original source. It still feels like someone could identify the source from that element.</p>

<p>Instead of notching it out, let&rsquo;s do a colorblocked overlap call-to-action. Once I do that, I realize the opportunity to mirror that visual language on the top left with the logo. Given that the original source is so flat, I&rsquo;ll add a subtle drop shadow to give those elements some depth.</p>

<p>You can see that, with just a few moves, I&rsquo;ve moved this away from an interface I&rsquo;ve stolen to something that feels way more original.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/hero4-overlap.png" alt="Hero unit with overlapped button and logo" />

<p>If I take that approach to each element of this page&mdash;just a few moves each to distinguish it from its original source&mdash;I can easily go from a design I&rsquo;ve stolen to an original version I&rsquo;ve invented on my own.</p>

<img src="http://danmall.me/articles/stealing-your-way-to-original-designs/invent.png" alt="Invented comp" />

<p>And lastly, a side-by-side comparison for effect.</p>

<p>I hope this was a useful primer in showing you how to steal you way to an original design. In the words of English philosopher <abbr>C.E.M.</abbr> Joad, &ldquo;Creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.&rdquo; The more obscure your references, the more sources you combine, the more moves away from the original you can take, the more original your design will become.</p>

<p>For those that want to dissect the final source file in more detail, you can <a href="spaceZzzz.psd.zip">download the <abbr title="Photoshop Document">PSD</abbr> (51.2MB) here</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck with your stealing!</p>

<p><span class="dm-dp-openingLines">Pilots are one of</span> the best ways to put your design system through its paces, especially before the design system even gets to a <var>v1</var>. Like television pilots help test audience reactions to a series concept without investing significant resources to create the whole thing, application pilots are a good foundation for ensuring your design system&rsquo;s design and code are battle-tested.</p> 

<p>Here is how my teams and I identify great pilot candidates.</p> 

<p>First, we want to know what kinds of digital products a design system should help our client to make. We&rsquo;ll ask them to tee up as many product presentations as they can muster. They&rsquo;ll usually do this by either generating a list of product owners that tend to be early adopters/risk takers, or they&rsquo;ll issue an open call for willing participants.</p>

<p>We review anywhere from dozens to hundreds of existing products to get a good lay of the land for what the organization makes regularly and supports. This might be walking through products in person or on a screenshare with a product owner, asking questions and exploring as many of the hidden crevasses as possible. It also could be clicking through public or private apps ourselves, inventorying what&rsquo;s common.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, we&rsquo;ll also do an <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/">interface inventory</a>, taking note of the frequency of usage of common components.</p> 

<p>We&rsquo;ll then try and reverse-engineer where our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a> comes into play: what 20% can we design and build that can assuage 80% of the wheel reinvention pain?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a sweet spot for great pilot candidates after planning for the pilot has begun but before it gets designed or built. If a product isn&rsquo;t far enough along in planning, we likely don&rsquo;t know enough about it to say whether it&rsquo;ll make for a good pilot or not. But if it&rsquo;s already in the process of being created or recreated, it&rsquo;s probably too far along to be able to integrate parts&mdash;read: component design, patterns, and/or working code&mdash;from the design system without some amount of refactor, which teams in need of a design system often can&rsquo;t afford.</p>

<p>Once we find a some good potential candidates in that sweet spot, there&rsquo;s a set of criteria we use to determine a pilot&rsquo;s potential efficacy:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Potential for common components.</strong> Does this pilot have many components that can be reused in other products?</li>
    <li><strong>Potential for common patterns.</strong> Does this pilot have many patterns that can be reused in other products?</li>
    <li><strong>High-value elements.</strong> Even if uncommon, is there a component or pattern with high-business value that is the heart of this project? We&rsquo;re talking elements that are integral to a flow or audience that has unusually high value for the organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical feasibility.</strong> How simple is a technical implementation of the design system? Is a large refactor required?</li>
    <li><strong>Available champion.</strong> Will someone working on this product see it through and celebrate/evangelize using the design system (and even contributing back to it)?</li>
    <li><strong>Scope.</strong> Is this work accomplishable in our pilot timeframe of [3&ndash;4 weeks] (insert your timing here)?</li>
    <li><strong>Technical independence.</strong> Is the work decoupled enough from other legacy design and code that there are clear start and end points?</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing potential.</strong> Will this work excite others to use the design system?</li>
</ol>

<p>You might already see where we could go with this. Using a simple point system where <var>1</var> indicates a low match and <var>10</var> indicates high efficacy, you could create a Pilot Scorecard that shows you which products to tackle in priority order:</p>

<p>Starting with pilots before you have anything in your design system allows <a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html#inventionhappensintheproducts">invention to happen in the products</a>. In the next pass of using your design system, you can <a href="/articles/cooking-with-design-systems/">cook with your new ingredients</a> to make sure you have the right pieces in place.</p>

<p>Have you used pilots in your design systems journeys? How have they helped you?</p>

<ol>
    <li>I&rsquo;m talking specifically about products that are being built from scratch or reimagined. However, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that you may have a product already built that&rsquo;s clearly a good foundation for a design system. If that&rsquo;s the case, no need to pilot; instead, extract and abstract the appropriate components and patterns you need. Mobile designer <a href="https://twitter.com/bigmediumjosh">Josh Clark</a> describes this in more detail in his article, &ldquo;<a href="https://bigmedium.com/ideas/boring-design-systems.html">The Most Exciting Design Systems are Boring</a>.&rdquo; <a href="#fn1-source">&#8617;</a></li>
    <li>In his article, &ldquo;<a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/patterns-components-2ce778cbe4e8">Patterns &#8800; Components</a>,&rdquo; systems designer <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanacurtis">Nathan Curtis</a> describes the difference between a pattern and a component, which is why they&rsquo;re separate items in this article. <a href="#fn2-source">&#8617;</a></li>

<p>My father-in-law (a retired pastor) shared with me a simple framework he crafted from many years of preaching sermons week after week. Every good story has these three components:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Bad news.</li>
    <li>Good news. </li>
    <li>So what?</li>
</ol>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know how to tell a good story, but that&rsquo;s easily solved with this simple trick. You&rsquo;ll soon have your listeners hanging on your every word!</p>

<p>(See how I just used that framework? 😉 )</p>

<p>A great design system should equip you to quickly and confidently create delicious user experiences. Creating a great design system is a lot like stocking a very specific kind of kitchen.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I run a food truck. I have a small kitchen in said truck, so I need to be judicious in what ingredients I stock. To determine the right ingredients to bring along, I can ask myself a few simple questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What dishes will I <em>definitely</em> make? What ingredients do I need to make those dishes?</li>
    <li>What dishes <em>might</em> I make? What ingredients do I need to make those dishes?</li>
</ol>

<p>What&rsquo;s on my menu? If I run a Mexican street food truck, I&rsquo;ll have main dishes like tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. I&rsquo;ll have a few appetizers and sides like street corn, empanadas, and chips &amp; salsa. But, I&rsquo;ll also need the ingredients that make those mains and sides, even if they&rsquo;re not specifically listed on my menu&mdash;lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage, mayonnaise, salt, pepper, paprika, avocado, rice, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, tortillas, tomatilos, oregano, cilantro, cheese, etc. These are all the things I&rsquo;ll need to bring with me onto the truck.</p>

<p>Part of what&rsquo;s important in what I&rsquo;m bringing is also what I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> bringing. Dill and cinnamon are great spices in general, but I don&rsquo;t plan on making anything with them, so I can leave out for now. (And I can always change my mind later.)</p>

<p>If I&rsquo;ve been running my food truck for a while, I know that some dishes will almost always get ordered, so I can prep them in advance. I can start cooking rice. I can chop lettuce and cabbage. I can set up my <a class="dm-u-fontStyle--italic" lang="fr" href="https://vimeo.com/177133790#t=1h16m28s" title="&ldquo;Build Right: Maker Series on Design Workflow with Dan Mall&rdquo; on Vimeo">mise en place</a> so that it&rsquo;s ready for use when customers start ordering.</p>

<p>I can get some headstarts too. I can throw a cup of salsa and a handful of chips into a bag and seal it; no more assembly required. I can also pre-cook beef with onions, spices, and marinade to be ready to throw into a taco or burrito. This one needs to be finished with a tortilla and some veggies, but I don&rsquo;t need to start from scratch everytime someone orders a beef dish.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s helpful for me to think about these things in categories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Raw ingredients</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Lettuce</li>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>

            <li>
                <em>Sides</em>
                <ul>

                    <li>Empanadas</li>
                    <li>&hellip;</li>
                </ul>

<p>Turns out this is also a pretty good model for organizing a design system.</p>

<p>Even though many have been using these phrases for years, you can tell it&rsquo;s still early days regarding things like &ldquo;design systems,&rdquo; &ldquo;component libraries,&rdquo; and &ldquo;style guides&rdquo; because we can&rsquo;t yet get the words right. Everyone insists that they&rsquo;re different, but we still use them interchangeably. <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/researching-design-systems/">Canonical definitions for each have yet to emerge</a>. Until they do, I&rsquo;ll use the ones that best fit for and most appeal to me.</p>

<p>Graphics editors like Photoshop and Sketch allow you&mdash;but also force you&mdash;to create everything from scratch. A strict component library might encourage you to only use the components as they come without any customization; a good example was <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dotcom/cn/devnet/flash/articles/skinning_flash_cs3/_jcr_content/articlecontentAdobe/image.img.jpg/1276162998293.jpg">Flash&rsquo;s component library</a> (Bueller?). Design systems fit somewhere in between. A design system is the smallest set of tools to help me effectively create what I need.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that graphics editors and component libraries aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive. Most examples in the wild aren&rsquo;t purely one or the other, or at least easily convert closer to the certain. <a href="https://www.sketchappsources.com/tag/kit.html">Add a UI Kit to Sketch</a> and it gets closer to a design system. Add some spacing and sizing tokens to a component library and it gets closer to a design system.</p>

<p>Testing a design system&rsquo;s efficacy is easy on paper: can you easily create what you intend to? Back to our metaphor, can I quickly make a delicious burrito? Like a well-stocked but limited kitchen, a good design system is a combination of raw ingredients and headstarts to make delicious dishes. It&rsquo;s as many of these things as you need, and no more.</p>

<p>I wanted to create and maintain this site primarily with a design system&mdash;not a graphics editor or a component library&mdash;so I brought along a limited pantry:</p>

<p>How did I decide what&rsquo;s what? I&rsquo;m glad you asked.</p>

<p>Prolific designer <a href="https://www.miltonglaser.com/">Milton Glaser</a> <a href="http://brendandawes.com/blog/Glaser">said</a>, &ldquo;I move things around until they look right,&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s most of what I do in Photoshop and Sketch, I need a way to do that in code.</p>

<p>First, I need to make the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that need to be moved around. That means writing the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> I need as <a href="http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/" title="&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk about Semantics,&rdquo; on HTML5Doctor">semantically</a> as possible.</p>

<p>Then, I started to build some &ldquo;move around&rdquo; tools. I&rsquo;m a big fan of how <a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">Harry Roberts</a> <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/" title="&ldquo;BEMIT: Taking the BEM Naming Convention a Step Further,&rdquo; by Harry Roberts">suggests organizing <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></a> for maximum maintainability, and I just wrapped a project with <a href="http://twitter.com/brad_frost">Brad Frost</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/frostyweather">Ian Frost</a> where we used with a similar <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/css-architecture-for-design-systems/"><abbr>CSS</abbr> architecture</a>. I also wanted to try out the <a href="https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid">8-point grid</a> that all the kids are raving about.</p>

<p>I created <a href="https://github.com/danmall/danielmallcom/blob/master/-/c/_scss/variables.scss">some variables</a> so that I can change spacing globally if the 8-pt thing doesn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<pre><code>
$spacing            :       8;

$xs                 :       $spacing;
$s                  :       $spacing * 2;
$m                  :       $spacing * 3;
$l                  :       $spacing * 4;
$xl                 :       $spacing * 5;
$xxl                :       $spacing * 6;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, some spacing mixins:</p>

<pre><code>
@mixin dm-u-margin--0 {
margin: 0;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--xs {
margin: $xs + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--s {
margin: $s + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--m {
margin: $m + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--l {
margin: $l + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--xl {
margin: $xl + px;
}

@mixin dm-u-margin--xxl {
margin: $xxl + px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>A few notes about that:</p>

    <li><code>u-</code> stands for &ldquo;utility.&rdquo; More on this later.</li>
    <li>I made <a href="https://github.com/danmall/danielmallcom/blob/master/-/c/_scss/mixins.scss">a lot of individual mixins</a> for margins (top, right, bottom, left) and padding. Seems like overkill, but comes in really handy.</li>      
</ul>

<p>I also duplicated those mixins in a <a href="https://github.com/danmall/danielmallcom/blob/master/-/c/_scss/utilities.scss"><code>utilities.scss</code></a> file so that I could use them in both <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr>:</p>

<pre><code>
.dm-u-margin--0 {
@include dm-u-margin--0;
}

.dm-u-margin--xs {
@include dm-u-margin--xs;
}

.dm-u-margin--s {
@include dm-u-margin--s;
}

.dm-u-margin--m {
@include dm-u-margin--m;
}

.dm-u-margin--l {
@include dm-u-margin--l;
}

.dm-u-margin--xl {
@include dm-u-margin--xl;
}

.dm-u-margin--xxl {
@include dm-u-margin--xxl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as <abbr title="Don&rsquo;t repeat yourself">DRY</abbr> as I&rsquo;d like it to be, but I&rsquo;m happy to trade principle for the pragmatism of moving quickly in code.</p>

<p>Once I feel like I have a thorough enough set of raw ingredients, <em>my goal is to create as much of the site as I can without opening my stylesheet again</em>. If I can do this, I&rsquo;m <em>using</em> my design system, as opposed to creating patterns on the fly.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do an example: a basic article page. I&rsquo;ll start by creating the title of the page:</p>


<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to style this headline to be somewhat large, have a little space on the left, and have some room below. Without a design system, I might create a new <code>class</code> and write some new styles, but remember: I want to use my design system and not add anything new to my stylesheet. So, I&rsquo;ll use some rules that I&rsquo;ve already created:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;h1 class="dm-u-text--xl dm-u-paddingLeft--m dm-u-marginBottom--l"&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>    

<p>This style of coding certainly isn&rsquo;t new; many framework like <a href="http://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a>, <a href="https://acss.io/">Atomic <abbr>CSS</abbr></a>, or <a href="http://johnpolacek.github.io/expressive-css/">Expressive <abbr>CSS</abbr></a> have suggested this for a long time. The biggest criticism of this approach is that it isn&rsquo;t much better than writing inline styles, and you lose a lot of the benefits of the cascade that made <abbr>CSS</abbr> so powerful in the first place. True, at first glance, it doesn&rsquo;t look much different than:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;h1 style="font-size: 40px; padding-left: 24px; margin-bottom: 32px;"&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>              

<p>But I&rsquo;d argue that there are still a few benefits:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Visual consistency.</strong> If you&rsquo;re using class names instead of inline styles and are using something like the 8-pt grid, you know you won&rsquo;t ever have a situation where one headline has 16px of padding and another has 17px. You&rsquo;re using your design system!</li>
    <li><strong>A limited pantry.</strong> The beauty and the curse that comes with a graphics editor is that the world is your oyster. Want to nudge that particular piece of text over half a pixel? Go for it. Make your developers go crazy and set your <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</abbr> users ablaze. Using your already established conventions through class names gives you a beneficial constraint. Part of Sketch&rsquo;s fast adoption with designers is no-doubt due to the fact that it&rsquo;s limited toolbar is a welcome constraint from the hundreds of tools at your fingertips in Photoshop. Take that same restrained approach to <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/dan-mall/2012-september-12">deciding in the browser</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>You get an even bigger benefit if you take this a step further. Let&rsquo;s say you create 3 more of these headlines. Congrats! You&rsquo;re on your way to a bona fide pattern! This is where I&rsquo;d crack back open my stylesheet, not to write more styles but to codify the pattern.</p>

<p>First question: is it a <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/content-display-patterns/">content pattern or a display pattern</a>? It&rsquo;s a bit too specific to apply to a particular type of content; calling this a <code>articleTitle</code> may make me think twice about using this on the Contact page. Display pattern it is! We&rsquo;ll call this our <code>bigTitle</code>. I&rsquo;ll use a <code>dp-</code> prefix to mark it as such. So, the <abbr>HTML</abbr> turns into:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;h1 class="dm-dp-bigTitle"&gt;Cooking up Design Systems&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my stylesheet, I&rsquo;ll create a new rule for my new display pattern, but instead of writing custom declarations, I&rsquo;ll instead use my existing mixins, cut-and-pasted directly from my markup. Again, I want to <em>use what&rsquo;s already in my design system</em>, keeping things as <abbr>DRY</abbr> as I can. That rule would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>
.dm-dp-bigTitle {
@include dm-u-text--xl;
@include dm-u-paddingLeft--m;
@include dm-u-marginBottom--l;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That way, I&rsquo;ll almost always know at a glance as I skim my stylesheet what parts use the design system I&rsquo;ve established and what parts deviate.</p>

<p>Last thing: I like to leave some space at the bottom of every rule for &ldquo;seasoning.&rdquo; In cooking, there&rsquo;s this phrase called &ldquo;season to taste,&rdquo; which means that you can continue to add spices and herbs if a dish doesn&rsquo;t taste perfect when it&rsquo;s done cooking. It might not be part of the recipe, but you need it in this specific instance. In the case of code, that might be applying a background color to an element or adding a particular animation:</p>

<pre><code>
.dm-dp-bigTitle {
@include dm-u-text--xl;
@include dm-u-paddingLeft--m;
@include dm-u-marginBottom--l;

// seasoning
background-color: gold;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, you can quickly visually identify what parts of this block are part of the design system, and which is some extra seasoning. After noticing that you&rsquo;re writing <code>background-color: gold;</code> 4 or 5 different times, then you can consider adding it permanently to your design system as a utility and/or mixin.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this example showed how you can bring some of the <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> decision-making process you previously did in a graphics editor into the browser, as long as you have the right code approach to support it.</p>

<p>Now you&rsquo;re cooking!</p>

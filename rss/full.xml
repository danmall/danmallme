<p><span class="dm-dp-initialText">Continuing the tradition</span> from <a href="https://danmall.me/articles/2020-year-in-review/" title="2020 Year in Review">2020</a>, <a href="https://danmall.me/articles/2019-year-in-review/" title="2019 Year in Review">2019</a>, and <a href="https://danmall.me/articles/2018-year-in-review/" title="2018 Year in Review">2018</a>, here’s my reflection on 2021.</p><h2 id="family-%26-home">Family &amp; Home</h2><p>2021 marks the first full year my family and I have lived in our dream house. In general, I think of this as a calm house. It’s quiet. Maybe that’s the neighborhood. Maybe that’s the open floor plan or the minimal interior. Maybe we moved here in the middle of a recommended quarantine and there wasn’t much to do, so we didn’t do much other than be home with each other. I don’t exactly know <em>why</em> it is, but I like it.</p><p>The school district here is amazing; the kids seem to love it. I think they’re doing a great job of managing to keep the kids as safe as they can amidst a global pandemic that continues to ebb and flow.</p><p>Sidda has a teacher that makes learning fun. He seems to spend a lot of time developing his students’ critical thinking skills, and I’m grateful for that on behalf of Sidda’s future self. I’m sad that she no longer goes to school with her best friend since preschool, but we organize frequent enough play dates for them to spend time together.</p><p>Charlie seems to like her friends a lot more at the new school, and she seems to have a lot more of them here too.</p><p>This year, I saw <a href="http://emilymall.me/">Em</a> start and immediately crush a new career in interior design. She’s so good at everything she does.</p><div class="dm-c-image dm-c-image--2up"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/tilly.jpg" alt="Tilly, our sheepadoodle"> <img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/tilly-max.jpg" alt="Tilly &amp; Max"></div><p>Our dog Max seemed to need a friend, so we got him Matilda (Tilly for short). They seem to get along fine enough, although there are a little too many “I’m the big brother” moments for my liking, even though she’s already way bigger than he is.</p><p>Our new house has a pool. It’s the first time I’ve lived in a house with a pool, so I learned how to swim this summer. I’m so proud of myself for this! I’ve loved being in the water since I was a kid, but I never knew how to tread water or figure out what to do with my breathing. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SQkRWm6jW8">this video</a>, paid pretty close attention to my kids’ swim teacher, and practiced every day for at least an hour or two. By the end of the summer, I was swimming! I’m still not a strong swimmer, but I’m not afraid of being in the 10-foot deep end of our pool since I can tread water enough + know how to blow bubbles underwater, at least enough to casually make my way to the edge before I get too tired. Next summer, my goal is to be able to jump off our diving board without holding my nose!</p><h2 id="health%2C-wellness%2C-and-self-care">Health, wellness, and self-care</h2><p>Gosh it’s been tough to find some kind of regular way to invest in my physical health. I was playing basketball weekly in 2019, and then COVID happened. I started playing regularly again in September in a local pick-up league after getting vaccinated in April, and I did that every week until the end of the year. I was looking forward to picking that up again this year, but then Omicron. Grr.</p><p>I’m not sure what I’ll do to keep fit. I hate running. I’m vaguely interested in yoga lately. Em just got <a href="https://joinfightcamp.com/">FightCamp</a>, so I may try that. One of the nice things about photography is that I walk a few miles while shooting once every week or two.</p><p>I still drink a lot of soda.</p><p>On the mental health front, I’ve been working with a new therapist since August, and that’s been <em>great</em>. I previously used <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/">BetterHelp</a>, which I thought was more than affordable. But I guess you get what you pay for. I was matched with and tried 3 therapists that I just didn’t jive with, and the 1 that I did jive with wasn’t licensed in my new state after I moved so I couldn’t continue working with her.</p><p>After that, I sought out a therapist who could work with me on the specific things I wanted to work on. A friend referred me to someone who is both a therapist and a coach. I’m paying more than I ever have for my mental health, but wow it’s worth every penny.</p><div class="dm-c-image dm-c-image--2up"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/tattoo--dan.jpg" alt="Dan Mall’ new tattoo"> <img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/tattoo--jon.jpg" alt="Jon Mall’ new tattoo"></div><p>In 2021, my brother and I got <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall/status/1238901529928699905">matching tattoos in memory of our grandfather</a>. This year we finished those tattoos.</p><h2 id="videos-%26-photos">Videos &amp; photos</h2><p>In 2021, I took 28,893 photos and videos, which is 129% more than last year’s 12,641 photos and videos. Of those almost 30k photos and videos, I posted 111 (less than 1%) to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danmallphotos/">my photo Instagram account</a>, but the point for me was to invest more in shooting the photos as opposed to posting them. I’m proud to say I’ve done that!</p><p>Halfway through the year, I upgraded my <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/telephoto-zoom/ef-70-200mm-f-4l-usm">Canon EF 70–20mm f/4L USM</a> lens for a <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/lenses/ef/telephoto-zoom/ef-100-400mm-f-4-5-5-6l-is-ii-usm">Canon EF 100–400mm f/4.5–5.6L IS II USM</a>, and I’m so glad I did. Having a versatile spread of focal lengths (16–35mm, 24–70mm, 100–400mm) makes me that much more excited to shoot to see what I can capture.</p><p>I also picked up a <a href="https://www.dji.com/air-2s">DJI Air 2S</a> drone this year, and I’m loving it. It’s not just the photos or videos; I really enjoy flying it around and seeing what the world looks like from that perspective.</p><p>Here are a few of my favorite shots I took in 2021:</p><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/philly-fire.jpg" alt="Philadelphia skyline"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/upenn-love.jpg" alt="Red LOVE statue on University of Pennsylvania campus nestled within green forestation"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/philly-city-hall.jpg" alt="Man crossing the street in front of Philadelphia’ City Hall"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/philly-skyline-bfb-sunset.jpg" alt="Philadelphia skyline from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge at sunset"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/leopard.jpg" alt="Amur leopard lying down"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/new-mexico-lightning.jpg" alt="Lightning storm in New Mexico"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/hancock-overlook.jpg" alt="Hancock Overlook hairpin road, New Hampshire"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/vermont-foliage.jpg" alt="House nestled at the bottom of a hill in Vermont during fall with beautiful leaves changing colors"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/parx-liberty-carousel.jpg" alt="Long exposure of Parx Liberty Carousel in motion so that it looks like a spaceship"></div><div class="dm-c-image"><img src="https://danmall.com/static/img/articles/2021-year-in-review/point-udall-sunrise.jpg" alt="Sunrise at Point Udall, the easternmost point of the United States"></div><p>I became way more comfortable with video processing and editing in 2021. I found a lot of excuses to shoot some home videos and make thanks and happy birthday videos to send to friends and clients that forced me to get better at Final Cut Pro. I’ve got a new course coming out this year that will certainly make those new skills come in handy.</p><h2 id="books">Books</h2><p>This year, I noticed that I enjoyed my reading more than I typically have in past years. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I had less of a stomach for business books than I typically do and I turned to more memoirs, biographies, and autobiographies written by or about mixed race people and/or people of color.</p><p>In 2021, I read or attempted to read:</p><ol><li><cite>DisneyWar</cite>, by James.

All of my travel in 2021 was for personal reasons. I visited:</p><ol><li>Nassau, Bahamas</li><li>Washington, <abbr title="District of Columbia">DC</abbr></li><li>Hunter, <abbr title="New York">NY</abbr></li><li>Orlando, <abbr title="Florida">FL</abbr> (twice)</li><li>Tucson, <abbr title="Arizona">AZ</abbr></li><li>Asheville, <abbr title="North Carolina">NC</abbr></li><li>New England</li><li>Shenandoah Valley, <abbr title="Virginia">VA</abbr></li><li>New York City, <abbr>NY</abbr></li><li>Los Angeles, <abbr title="California">CA</abbr></li><li>St. Croix, <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Virgin Islands</li></ol><h2 id="sole-man">Sole man</h2><p>I added a few new sneakers to the collection in 2021:</p><ol><li>Paris Saint-Germain × Air Jordan 1 High Zoom Comfort “Paris”</li><li>Air Jordan 1 “Bordeaux”</li><li>Nike DBreak-Type</li><li>Air Jordan 1 Hi FlyEase</li><li>Nike Kobe 9 Elite “Inspiration”</li><li>Air Jordan 1 Mid “Chile Red”</li></ol><h2 id="work">Work</h2><p>Work was tough for me in 2021. I wrote a lot about that in my <a href="/articles/superfriendly-2021-wrap-up/">SuperFriendly 2021 Wrap-Up</a>.</p><p><a href="https://usearcade.com/">Arcade</a> was also a big part of my professional life in 2021. Unfortunately, a lot of my attention was focused on trying to lead SuperFriendly, so progress on Arcade slowed to a crawl as a result. I’m hoping to dive back into Arcade in a serious way in 2022.</p><h2 id="dream-project">Dream project</h2><p>2021 finally gave me the chance to work with my dream client of 23 years. While I can’t say too much more here, the work was my favorite kind of challenging and the team was incredible to work with. I’m still figuring out how to celebrate an achievement I’ve waited so long for, but I think I’ve landed on what I’m going to do. Hopefully I can share more about this soon.</p><h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2><p>Early in my career, it was a big dream to speak at a conference. As much as being on a conference stage still feels like a great honor to me, I’ve spoken about design at almost 200 events and platforms in the last 13 years of my career. This is the first year I’ve strongly felt that urge waning.</p><p>I don’t think I have much that I’d like to say in that format anymore.</p><p>Also, I never really admitted until recently how little I enjoy writing a talk! No matter how much advance notice I have, I still somehow end up writing the talk a day before the event, pulling just-about-all-nighters and not giving myself enough revision time to clearly articulate what I’m trying to communicate anyway.</p><p>That said, I have learned that, although I like giving talks less and less, I still really enjoy teaching! When I’m in a room full of people—physical or virtual—I’d rather talk <em>with</em> them than <em>at</em> them. I prefer an interactive format to a broadcast format. It’s no coincidence that my work and “public appearances” are trending towards teaching, coaching, and workshops. I see this trend solidifying for me in the next year.</p><p>In 2021:</p><ul><li>I talked to the community at <a href="https://www.freelancefounders.com/">Freelance Founders</a> about making more money.</li><li>I taught design systems workshops through <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a>, <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/">Rosenfeld Media</a>, <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/">Clarity</a>, and <a href="https://smashingconf.com/">Smashing Conference</a>.</li><li>I shared my one favorite career tip at RGD’s <a href="https://www.rgd.ca/creative-directions/general-info">Creative Directions</a>.</li><li>I talked about healthy work boundaries at the <a href="https://howdesignlive.com/design-leadership">HOW Design Creative Leadership Summit</a>.</li><li>I talked to the <a href="https://bureauofdigital.com/">Bureau of Digital</a> agency owner community about the pros and cons of the SuperFriend model.</li><li>I participated in a Twitter Space conversation about design systems with <a href="https://maecapozzi.com">Mae Capozzi</a>, <a href="https://noworries.nz">Josh Harwood</a>, and organized by <a href="https://donnavitan.com">Donna Vitan</a></li><li>I talked to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thechrisdo/?hl=en">Chris Do</a> at The Futur about <a href="https://thefutur.com/podcast/start-your-own-design-agency">running a distributed, network-based business</a>.</li><li>I talked to <a href="https://www.lurkmoophy.com">Luke Murphy</a> at Zeroheight about <a href="https://zeroheight.com/blog/s02e08-dan-mall/">how designers and engineers can better collaborate</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h2><ul><li>I tried to make my own sneakers.

<p><span class="dm-dp-initialText">Against many criteria</span>, 2021 was <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a>’s worst year to date and one of my biggest professional failures. It was time for a big change.</p><h2 id="2021-superfriendly-in-numbers">2021 SuperFriendly in numbers</h2><p>From a quantitative perspective, a lot of things seemed to be headed in the direction I wanted for the company. I decided a few years ago to try to scale the company up, to see how far the business model could stretch, and the trajectory seemed to be appropriately headed in that direction, especially against some of the goals I laid out around this time in <a href="https://danmall.me/articles/superfriendly-2020-wrap-up/" title="SuperFriendly 2020 Wrap-Up">2020</a> and <a href="https://danmall.me/articles/superfriendly-in-2020/" title="SuperFriendly in 2020">2019</a>.</p><h3 id="time-spent">Time spent</h3><ul><li>In <strong>2019</strong>, I worked <strong>2,040 hours</strong>, an average of <strong>39 hours/week</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>2020</strong>, I worked <strong>1,903 hours</strong>, an average of <strong>37 hours/week</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>2021</strong>, I worked <strong>1,642 hours</strong>, an average of <strong>31 hours/week</strong>.</li></ul><p>I’m generally happy to see my time spent working decrease year over year, but I also want to think that I’m learning how to have more impact with less time. This year, I felt the opposite. I worked less than I ever have, but I also felt like I had little to no impact. And yes: I was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html">languishing</a>. And yes: despite working less than I ever have, I was <a href="https://mayakaczorowski.com/blogs/burnout">burnt out</a>.</p><p>Here’s how I spent my time in 2021.</p><ul><li><strong>Creative Direction:</strong> 478 hours (29%)</li><li><strong>Vacation:</strong> 272 hours (17%)</li><li><strong>Admin:</strong> 221 hours (13%)</li><li><strong>Business Development:</strong> 180 hours (11%)</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> 107 hours (7%)</li><li><strong>Speaking/Conferences:</strong> 104 hours (6%)</li><li><strong>Coaching:</strong> 98 hours (6%)</li><li><strong>Writing:</strong> 56 hours (3%)</li><li><strong>Interviewing/Recruiting:</strong> 38 hours (2%)</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous/Other:</strong> 88 hours (5%)</li></ul><h3 id="projects">Projects</h3><p>We did <strong>25 projects in 2021</strong>, a 32% increase from 2020’s 19 projects, including:</p><ul><li>Creating online magazine <cite><a href="https://www.twilio.com/the-current/">The Current</a></cite> with Twilio</li><li>Launching the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/faith-liberty-trail/id1559109532">Faith and Liberty Trail App</a>, a guide to discovering Philadelphia’s hidden history</li><li>Online digital marketing help for Point72 like <a href="https://p72hyperscale.com/">Hyperscale</a>, <a href="https://p72.vc/">Point72 Ventures</a>, and others</li><li>Helping <a href="https://www.bigeye.com/">Bigeye</a> release some new features and functionality while improving their design system</li><li>Design system coaching, diagnostics, and consulting for 2 apparel companies, a technology company, a learning platform, a real estate startup, a marketing platform, and more</li></ul><p>Some of these are the best work to come out of SuperFriendly in a long while.</p><h3 id="revenue-%26-profit">Revenue &amp; Profit</h3><p>By the end of August of 2021, we had already made the same revenue we made in all of 2020. 2021 was shaping up to be the highest-grossing revenue year yet.</p><p>However, by the end of August of 2021, <strong>our profit was at -4% and continuing to trend downward</strong>. In other words, we were doing more projects than ever making more money, but also spending too much money in order to do so. Another month and, for the first time ever, we would have been completely out of cash.</p><p>Why didn’t I spot that sooner? A number of reasons, really.</p><ol><li>I simply wasn’t doing a good job paying attention. I was both busy and burnt out.</li><li>Project work is often a feast or famine business. Our pipeline has been consistently full for a few years, but we can’t control <em>when</em> work lands. The right project at the right time turns grim profits into abundant pockets. So there’s always hope that “if this project or that one hits by the end of the month, we’ll be just fine.” Until we’re not.</li><li>Refunds. I’ve always wanted SuperFriendly to earn its income. One of the outcomes I want for every one of our projects is for the client to feel or even say, “That was money well spent and I’d gladly spend it again.” In SuperFriendly’s history, we’ve only had 1 project where <em>we</em> felt we didn’t fully deliver what we should have, so we returned $5,000 to a client after completing the project. In 2021, we had <strong>3 projects</strong> where we weren’t able to fully deliver, to the sum tune of <strong>$106,500 that we refunded to those clients</strong>. None of them asked for a refund, but I couldn’t keep that money in good conscience, knowing that we hadn’t delivered on what we promised. As <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>, all of that is my fault for not being able to lead our teams to deliver the kind of work we promise. We never withheld or retracted pay from any of our SuperFriends, so this is money we paid out of our already-thin and dwindling profits.</li><li>There continues to be a global pandemic. I imagine that had at least some effect on the undercurrent of how work has been getting done—or not—in the world over the last year. I simultaneously feel like all of this was solely my fault and also that none of it is because of the state of the world. It’s probably somewhere in the middle.</li></ol><h2 id="people-%26-purpose">People &amp; Purpose</h2><ul><li>In 2020, we hired <strong>55 SuperFriends</strong>. In 2021, we hired <strong>58 SuperFriends</strong> (5% growth).</li><li>In 2020, we paid SuperFriends a total of <strong>$2,333,039.62.</strong> In 2021, we paid SuperFriends a total of <strong>$1,158,482.49</strong> (a 50% decrease).</li><li>In 2020, we paid SuperFriends <strong>an average of $42,418.90 each</strong>. In 2020, we paid SuperFriends <strong>an average of $21,453.38 each</strong> (a 49% decrease).</li><li>In 2020, we hired <strong>23 women (42%)</strong>. In 2021, we hired <strong>25 women (43%)</strong>.</li><li>In 2020, we hired <strong>21 people of color (38%)</strong>. In 2021, we hired <strong>25 people of color (36%)</strong>.</li></ul><p>In short, we didn’t improve really at all on any of our goals in hiring and creating better opportunities for more underrepresented folks in tech, and we didn’t pay our SuperFriends as much either.</p><h2 id="life-changing">Life-changing</h2><p>As important as that info above is, it’s still just reporting, not really analysis. Or—more crudely put—<a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/difference-web-reporting-web-analysis/">data puking</a>. What should we <em>do</em> next year as a result of all that data?</p><p>It turns out that there’s another metric that’s more important to me, one that I didn’t even realize existed until 2021, despite running SuperFriendly for almost a decade. When I think about what I want SuperFriendly to <em>do</em>, what <em>impact</em> I want it to have in the world, I want it to <strong>change people’s lives</strong>.</p><p>And sure: lots of business owners wants their company to change lives. It’s a trite idea by now, which is partially why I never really gravitated toward that kind of language before. But 2021 made me realize that that’s the specific phrase many of our previous SuperFriends and clients use when talking about their experience working with and for SuperFriendly. I realized it in 2021 because it didn’t happen as much, and I started to notice the lack.</p><p>The phrase “working with SuperFriendly was life-changing” often came up in the context of our <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">apprenticeship</a>. It was an intentional format to help people learn more, and, as a result, earn more too. (Expect to see the “learn and earn” language show up in future versions of SuperFriendly.) This was a direct action tied to our mission of “creating better opportunities for those who wouldn’t otherwise have them.”</p><p>I stopped the program in 2018 because I wasn’t doing a great job creating those kinds of opportunities for my apprentices between all the other things I was also doing. That was the primary impetus for wanting to scale SuperFriendly up. At the time, I was directing most of SuperFriendly’s projects myself. My hypothesis was that removing myself from client work and business development allowed others—and more of them—to occupy those roles us to create more pairing scenarios for more apprentices, interns, and junior people. And thus began almost 3 years of trying to scale up with more projects, more senior people to pair with, more money to provide more <a href="/essays/support-systems-for-learning/" title="Support Systems for Learning">support</a> to more people.</p><p>What I learned was that there’s a hefty overlap between those who say SuperFriendly was life-changing for them and those who worked directly with me (vs. indirectly with me or not at all). In 2021, I only count 2 SuperFriends that mentioned to me that their interactions with SuperFriendly were life-changing, and both of them worked directly with me. There have been other versions of the idea for others, like the fact that they learned a lot or that they love their team, but that particular phrase that was so prevalent before is now all but gone.</p><p>I can’t help but think that this decrease in changing lives is correlated with my lack of involvement in client work. As a <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>, I have less relevance to an apprentice than I have as a creative director, designer, or engineer. That’s an uncomfortable idea to me, but I’m trying to create space for the idea that this isn’t at all a judgment on others as well as giving myself permission to be better and more interested in an aspect of work that other people aren’t.</p><p>Changing someone’s life is difficult. It’s also a completely separate effort to take on. I lament that it’s not part of our industry’s job descriptions for creative directors or tech directors, but that’s the current reality. I didn’t <em>expect</em> for our more senior SuperFriends to figure out how to improve the lives of the other SuperFriends on their teams, but I certainly wanted it. I watched our SuperFriends struggle to balance tension between delivering for clients and supporting their team, and, as much as I encouraged them to prioritize the latter, I didn’t have a clear rubric for how to do that. “Do it how Dan would do it” is not a playbook, and I actively <em>discouraged</em> that line of thinking. But I also didn’t have a good alternative to put in its place.</p><p>Scaling is difficult too. I’m learning that it’s not my gift, and I’m not sure I’m interested in doing the work to get good at it.</p><p>What I <em>am</em> gifted at is seeing how there’s not tension but synergy between growing people and creating successful work and clients. One begets the others. I often remind our senior folks about the principle of “SuperFriends over clients,” which I’ll admit sounds a bit counterintuitive for a client services agency. It often confounds them, but I see it clearly. I’m slowly growing more comfortable around the idea that I have a vision for that that others don’t, and that’s where I should be putting my focus.</p><h2 id="the-edges-of-the-superfriend-model">The edges of the SuperFriend Model</h2><p>The SuperFriend Model—a network-based approach to staffing projects real-time with appropriate expertise—was ironically one of the things that got lost in the scaling (ironic because it’s a model designed specific to respond to the ebb and flow of scale). As much as I’ve actively rejected it over the years, 2021 saw SuperFriendly starting to act like a traditional agency, embracing the flaws of that model—mainly the crushing pressure of continual overhead against irregular and unpredictable pipelines—and not really adopting any of its benefits.</p><p>In 2021, I learned more deeply what the SuperFriend Model needs to succeed, some of which we had and some of which we didn’t. It needs a network supply that exceeds the pipeline demand. It needs someone whose job it is to continue to grow the network. It needs a steady supply of work. It needs laser focus on a niche. It needs ways to support and engage the people in the network. It needs a mechanism to train people in what it means to work like a SuperFriend. It needs a large and steady amount of working capital. All of these things and more combine to create life-changing opportunities for a SuperFriend, and, when that happens, it always translates to benefits for our clients. As many of those things become less available—especially capital—the SuperFriend Model becomes more and more difficult to sustain.</p><h2 id="back-to-the-future">Back to the future</h2><p>What does all of this mean? It means <strong>I’m concluding the experiment of scaling SuperFriendly.</strong></p><p>A friend and mentor of mine recently shared with me that they often longed for their days of running a small company even though they worked at one of the largest companies in the world. Why? They had more <em>impact</em> at their smaller company, despite the massive scale difference. Their parting words to me in that conversation were, “Scale isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.”</p><p>I’m returning to working on client work again, for a number of reasons.</p><p>With profits down to almost nothing, frankly, we need the cash. I’ve often shied away from working on projects myself with the logic that we could probably get someone else to do better work for less money. But I often forget that I’m also one of the most profitable SuperFriends because I can play multiple roles on a project from design to strategy to engineering and more. With less people who can do more things, there’s less to manage and more money to put away for a rainy day. I’m returning in part to the original, older version of SuperFriendly, albeit in a new way with the benefit of a decade of hindsight.</p><p>The other big reason for me to return to client work is that it’s the best vehicle for me to teach, which I love doing. Pairing someone with me while I’m working has historically been one of SuperFriendly’s most successful ways to accomplish our mission of creating better opportunities for those who wouldn’t otherwise have them.</p><h2 id="superfriendly-in-2022">SuperFriendly in 2022</h2><p>With a decade of hindsight, it’d be foolish to throw out some of the things that have worked in the past. Alex Hillman <a href="https://indyhall.org/2021/07/a-fresh-start-for-indy-hall">recently compared the opportunity to start over</a> to the ability to replay a video game after you’ve beat it but with the new powers and items you earned the first time around.</p><p>Here are some advantages and principles SuperFriendly’s had over the years that I’d like to play up in 2022:</p><ul><li>A sharp focus on design systems</li><li>Minimal overhead</li><li>Connection to amazing people in the industry</li><li>Priority on growing SuperFriends</li><li>Relentlessness on helping clients do one thing they wouldn’t have done without us</li></ul><p>A lot of that is continuing what we were already doing, but the big change is going to be relinquishing trying to do it a some large level of scale. I’ll probably share more of this in detail in the future, but I’m aiming for 4 clients or less in 2022, all of which I will personally be heavily involved with. I think less clients and less revenue will lead to deeper impact, larger profits, and better opportunities for SuperFriends. Less quantity, higher quality.</p><p>I’m grateful for the ability to run a business where I can change, experiment, and try different ways to accomplish my mission. Amongst all the change over the years, a constant has been that SuperFriendly is my better opportunity that I wouldn’t otherwise have.</p>

There’s one thing in particular that Jason once said to me that I remember every single day in my work: <em>it’s easier to revise than create</em>.</p><p>When we worked together, Jason would always finish his work hours or even days before I finished mine. At first, I chalked it up mostly to the fact that he had more experience than I did. But once I actually watched his process, I realized he was doing something important that I wasn’t: he was finishing his work faster by worrying less about whether what he was doing was good. I would push elements in my designs around for hours; Jason would place an element and leave it there. He’d get everything on the screen, and that’d be the end of his first version, even if it looked horrible. That allowed him to finish that version in an hour or less. Then he’d start on the next wave of work: revising what he’d made. The creation part—that first pass of going from nothing to something—is one of the most difficult parts of making something. Many have labeled it <a href="http://v2.danielmall.com/archives/2008/03/13/the_tyranny_of_a_blank_page.php">the tyranny of a blank page</a>, and one of the easiest ways to move past that stage is to fill it with something—anything—as quickly as possible. Jason is an expert at this.</p><h2 id="the-mcdonald%E2%80%99s-theory">The McDonald’s Theory</h2><p>Designer Jon Bell puts this same concept to use when helping a group decide where to eat for lunch, a seemingly simple task that often escalates into long bouts of frustration for the <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/is-being-hangry-really-a-thing-or-just-an-excuse/">hangry</a>. He calls it <a href="https://jonbell.medium.com/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d">The McDonald’s Theory</a>. He says:</p><blockquote><p>I use a trick with co-workers when we’re trying to decide where to eat for lunch and no one has any ideas. I recommend McDonald’s.</p><p>An interesting thing happens. Everyone unanimously agrees that we can’t possibly go to McDonald’s, and better lunch suggestions emerge.</p><p>Magic! It’s as if we’ve broken the ice with the worst possible idea, and now that the discussion has started, people suddenly get very creative. I call it the McDonald’s Theory: people are inspired to come up with good ideas to ward off bad ones.</p></blockquote><p>This explains a lot! It’s why your co-workers have few suggestions when you ask them what to design, but everyone suddenly has a strong opinion when you ask them to critique something you’ve already made. It’s why starting a startup and getting to the first <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> of a product sometime takes months or years, but subsequent releases are much faster.</p><p>These things can be frustrating if don’t understand why they happen. But once you realize that it’s easier to revise than create, you can use it to your advantage. Free yourself from the pressure of making something good at the initial stage, quickly get to the part where you’re revising instead of creating, and watch how much more quickly you can <a href="/articles/building-momentum/">build momentum</a>.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://danmall.com/articles/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GK_n_0RVcY" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>Have you ever felt like your projects were going a little bit too slow, like they were just dragging on you couldn’t really build momentum? I have two quick tips that I want to share with you that hopefully will make your projects feel faster and lighter.</p>
<h2 id="fight-the-waterfall">Fight the Waterfall</h2>
<p>On waterfall projects, most people are sitting around, except for one or two who are doing the majority of the work at that moment. Typically, that happens when designers are designing and developers are waiting around for the designers to finish.</p>
<p>One of the ways to correct that is to start all of the pieces of work a little bit earlier. The key to starting work early is not succumbing to the pressure of having to finish the work. Don’t worry about finishing. If you’re a developer, you can start doing things while your design or information architect are working because a lot of your work actually isn’t dependent on their work. Some of it is, so you probably won’t be able to finish, but that shouldn’t stop you from starting.</p>
<p>When you start things earlier than you expected to without pressure, it starts to feel like you’re building momentum.</p>
<h2 id="share-work-in-progress-early-and-often">Share Work-in-Progress Early and Often</h2>
<p>Typically, when you share work with your colleagues or a client or a stakeholder, you might expect them to have feedback. So, sharing work-in-progress feels premature because how can others be expected to give feedback if the full context of the work doesn’t yet exist?</p>
<p>Here’s the key: when you share work-in-progress, share it with the caveat that <em>no feedback is needed at this point</em>. You’re simply sharing it to let people know where you are. For example, if you have to make 12 wireframes, share it when you finish 2 or 3. Rather than spending a whole week to drop 12 wireframes, share 2 – 3 wireframes every 2 days. The more often you do this, you start to build rhythm, and rhythm builds momentum. It’s hard to feel the rhythm when there’s too much space between the beats.</p>
<p>The true hack here is that you’re avoiding one of the biggest things that drag projects to a halt: <strong>waiting for approval</strong>. If you’re posting work-in-progress often without feedback needed, you’re starting to create a work cadence that’s moving by default, rather than standing still by default. You’re short-circuiting the stop-and-go whiplash that comes with waiting for approvals. You’re creating a project culture where the default is progress and momentum that anyone can stop when necessary, instead of one that constantly needs to be jumpstarted again.</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton said it best in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion">laws of motion</a>: “an object at rest will stay and rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by an external force.” It’s science!</p>

<p><span class="dm-dp-initialText">I used to laugh</span> quietly to myself when <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a> clients came to us, asking to license our design system product. “We’re a services company,” we’d politely reply. “We don’t have a design system product to license to you.”</p>
<p>Inevitably, the next question would be, “Do you have a product you would recommend to us?”</p>
<p>When we dug further, many of those requests seemed to be specifically around <i><a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/glossary/#token">design tokens</a></i>, a concept pioneered by design systems evangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/jina/">Jina Anne</a> during her time at Salesforce, working on the <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/">Lightning Design System</a>. Of course, clients wouldn’t be asking for design tokens by name; they’d instead be looking for solutions that helped them “scale their brand,” “create a source of truth,” and other aspirations like that.</p>
<p>As much as we had—and have—great relationships with many friends building tools for the design system space, none of them really seemed to accomplish (or accomplish well) what these clients were asking for. So, like many services companies that see the same unsolved problem over and over again, we figured we might as well be the ones to try and solve it.</p>
<p>I built an embarrasingly simple proof-of-concept. I showed it to my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/LeslieSCamacho/">Leslie Camacho</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mikecarbone/">Mike Carbone</a>, and we decided to officially start <a href="https://usearcade.com/">Arcade</a> together in June 2020. For the last 10 months, we’ve been quietly building Arcade and using it on our own products—this site is actually <a href="https://api.usearcade.com/api/public/projects/603aa3d6806c0f0017cb65a5/exports/css/live">powered by Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>Today, we’ve launched <a href="https://usearcade.com/">a brand new site</a> and are ready to open up Arcade to a small number of teams to kick the tires and see how well a tool like Arcade serves their needs. The early access fee is $2500, and we’re looking specifically for teams that already understand and use design tokens, are open to our opinions on how to better manage brand decisions, and have a well-rounded, cross-disciplinary team of at least one designer, one engineer, and one product manager.</p>
<p>Does that sound like your team? Is Arcade the kind of solution you’ve been looking for? Head over to <a href="https://usearcade.com/">usearcade.com</a> and apply for early access!</p>

<p>As we at <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/">SuperFriendly</a> work with newer and/or more junior SuperFriends, I’m recognizing the need for different ways to support how people learn and grow. Learning comes in many different forms, and <em>I’m</em> learning that people need help with a lot of them. Learning can’t just be something a professional does in their own time <em>outside</em> of work; it has to be an integral part of the work itself.</p>
<p>Here are some specific <em>support systems</em> we’re trying to invest in more:</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-transfer">Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<h3 id="definition-knowledge-transfer">Definition</h3>
<p>This is probably the most common form—more commonly known as “teaching”—that most think of when they think of “learning.” Knowledge transfer is the idea that someone possesses information that you don’t, and you get that information by them bestowing it to you. The education system is primarily built on this type of learning, where experienced teachers bestow their knowledge upon eager students.</p>
<h3 id="how-knowledge-transfer-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>In order to do good work, SuperFriends need information about the client, which happens early in projects mostly through sales and onboarding conversations. So, they’re being “taught” the information they need to do the work they’re hired for.</p>
<p>We also hold monthly Snack ’n’ Learns—a cross-time-zone version of <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/lunch-and-learn">Lunch and Learns</a>—open to all SuperFriends across a variety of topics, some directly applicable to SuperFriendly projects like a panel about demos of things we’re all working on and others much more broad like an overview of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-knowledge-transfer">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>C- (average).</strong> We currently don’t do much yet to help SuperFriends patch skill gaps through knowledge transfer. One of the biggest criticisms of our <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/apprenticeships-superfriendly-academy/">apprenticeship</a> from former apprentices is that it focused too heavily on developing <a href="https://www.leadersedge.com/brokerage-ops/the-new-power-skills">power skills</a> and professionalism more than it did skills of craft. If someone isn’t strong enough at a skill like, say, <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr> design or data analysis, all we do now is assess that they’re underqualified, suggest they try to get better, and don’t match them to a project yet. We’ve started to try and correct that in small ways by doing things like purchasing online courses and conference/workshop tickets for SuperFriends.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-knowledge-transfer">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We’ve been creating a few libraries that SuperFriends can access at any time. Purchasing an online course should mean that all SuperFriends can utilize it (provided that the license allows for that). We’ve also started the process of collecting the Snack ’n’ Learn sessions into a curriculum that will eventually becoming a “SuperFriendly Fundamentals Library” that we can use to onboard new SuperFriends.</li>
	<li>We’ve started conversations with people who we can hire to act as consultants for the team of SuperFriends. They wouldn’t be on the team itself or be client-facing; their roles would be purely to support filling in knowledge gaps that SuperFriends need to do their work.</li>
	<li>For the last year, we’ve been trying a pairing system for every discipline on a project (design, engineering, producing, etc.) That’s working well in theory, but we still have a lot of kinks to work out in how to allow ample room for this style of work, as well as what kinds of expectations to have about each person in the pair. We’re continuing to tweak this dynamic from project to project and pair to pair to see what feels most useful, and I’m very hopeful that this will be extremely fruitful very soon for all involved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="knowledge-seeking">Knowledge Seeking</h2>
<h3 id="definition-knowledge-seeking">Definition</h3>
<p>Knowledge seeking is the typical <i lang="la">modus operandi</i> of the self-starter. Self-starters are generally good at finding their own solutions, as opposed to having those solutions given to them or mandated. That means a lot of reading, watching videos, exploring, and generally an insatiable curiosity as compared to the expectation of being taught by someone else. One of my hypotheses in starting the apprenticeship was that it’s not ironic to <em>teach</em> someone how to be a self-starter as opposed to it being a character or personality trait. I evaluated that by looking at how much the capacity for knowledge seeking—and confidence in it—changed over time.</p>
<h3 id="how-knowledge-seeking-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>For better or worse—probably worse—our industry is drawn to people who do their own knowledge seeking as a matter of habit. Those who have a lot of experience with knowledge seeking tend to be more self-sufficient than others. We don’t really “support” knowledge seeking as much as we try to continually encourage it.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-knowledge-seeking">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>D (below average).</strong> I don’t know if it’s counterintuitive to try and <em>support</em> knowledge seeking, but I <em>do</em> know that we don’t explicitly encourage it or show SuperFriends exactly how there’s space for it on projects. It always seems to feel like something extra. That’s not great.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-knowledge-seeking">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Reward knowledge seeking as part of the work. I’m not quite sure what good rewards are for this. Financial incentive? Public and private praise? Something else?</li>
	<li>Explicitly <em>discourage</em> the idea that knowledge seeking should only happen outside of work time.</li>
	<li>Build time and space into project plans specifically for knowledge seeking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<h3 id="definition-purpose">Definition</h3>
<p>As Daniel Pink articulates in his book <cite><a href="https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/">Drive</a></cite>, “autonomous people working toward mastery perform at very high levels, but those who do so in the service of some greater objective can achieve even more.”</p>
<h3 id="how-purpose-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>One of our interview questions for both new and seasoned SuperFriends at the beginning of each project is, “What do you want and need out of your work right now in the season of life you’re in?” Historically, the answers have ranged from:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Money</li>
	<li>Distraction</li>
	<li>Some sort of impact in the world</li>
	<li>Opportunity to work on a specific kind of project or with a specific kind of client</li>
	<li>Learn a new skill</li>
	<li>Chance to hone a current skill</li>
	<li>Learn directly from a person with specific experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Our job on the SuperFriendly side and the Directors and Producers on the account becomes to help prioritize these outcomes for each individual SuperFriends.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-purpose">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>B+ (above average).</strong> We regularly have new SuperFriends that say things like, “Wow, no one’s ever asked me what my personal goals are for a project.”</p>
<p>We also start every new project with a “Superpowers Session,” where, in front of the whole team, a Producer reads out why each person was chosen for this work, what they bring to it, and also what they want to get out of it. This is the first step in making everyone on the team accountable for each of their teammates’ stated goals.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-purpose">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Make SuperFriends’ goals more present <em>throughout</em> a project, not just in the beginning. Projects start with a lot of momentum around personal goals, but that tends to wane as a project gets going and everyone is in the weeds.</li>
	<li>Normalize the idea that projects are about everyone’s professional <em>and</em> personal goals being met, not just our clients’ briefs. One thing I’ve been trying to say and signal lately is, “SuperFriendly is about SuperFriends, not clients.” Just yesterday, I had a conversation with a long-time SuperFriend who said to me, “I love the idea that we participate in a way we <em>want</em> to, but I don’t think that conversation can always be completely decoupled from how things might functionally get done.” It made me realize there’s still a lot of work to be done to get SuperFriends to accept the idea that projects aren’t just things where clients pay us to do whatever they want as a dry transaction. Instead, like grad school, I think of projects as great vehicles to explore professional and interpersonal theses, and clients get the tremendous benefit of the effects of that exploration.</li>
	<li>One idea of we’ve been talking about for a long time but haven’t yet implemented is to encourage SuperFriends to create their own “<a href="https://www.manualof.me/">user manuals</a>” to guide others on how to best work with them. I imagine that these manuals would contain some semblance of how a SuperFriend would want to grow and <em>why</em> they do what they do, and that would be integral to how people can relate to and interact with them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="stories-examples">Stories &amp; Examples</h2>
<h3 id="definition-examples">Definition</h3>
<p>Rather than talking about a concept abstractly, one way to help people learn is to tell and/or show them how it’s happened before in an applied way. Sharing stories and examples can go a long way toward making vague ideas concrete.</p>
<h3 id="how-examples-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>Not a lot. One of the biggest strengths of <a href="https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2018/04/18/hollywood-model-work/">the Hollywood model</a> is also its weakness: solitude. SuperFriends working on a project don’t know how a previous project went, because they weren’t there. That means stories have to be <em>actively</em> shared, because they’re almost impossible to passively stumble upon.</p>
<p>We have dedicated <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> channels for our most common disciplines: Directors, Producers, designers, and developers. Each has its own level of activity.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Our Producers channel is <em>incredibly</em> active. On the third Wednesday of every month, a different Producer will host an asychronous roundtable. They post a series of questions and prompts around a given topic, and as other Producers have time throughout the day, they’ll post their responses in threads for others to read and catch up on as they have a chance. Topics have ranged from onboarding techniques to meeting etiquette to flexibility, and lots more. Inevitably, those threads contain Producers saying different versions of, ”Here’s how I’ve dealt with or experienced that on my projects.”</li>
	<li>Our Directors channel is a ghost town (and I say that without judgment). We had a monthly roundtable Zoom call, but fewer and fewer showed up each month, I think as a combination of little incentive, busy schedules, and not knowing what to talk about.</li>
	<li>Our designers and developers channels have a steady buzz going, but they’re mostly functional. Lots of link sharing and debugging conversation, less story sharing.</li>
	<li>We’ve had two Snack ’n’ Learns that specifically share stories and examples. Our head of operations <a href="https://twitter.com/crystalvitelli">Crystal Vitelli</a> presented to our SuperFriends on “Things that Didn’t Go Well,” where she shared a few projects that went south and all the factors that led to that from contractual ambiguity to unstated expectations and lots more. We also had a panel discussion to talk about how Directors and Producers work together and how different that dynamic is from project to project, with lots of examples as proof points.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assessment-examples">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>F (failing).</strong> We do a really poor job of sharing our stories both internally and externally. <a href="https://superfriendlydesign.systems/helped/">Case studies</a> are an attempt, but they’re too time-consuming and difficult to create regularly and honestly trend more towards marketing pieces for prospective clients than helpful guides for SuperFriends.</p>
<p>We don’t as of yet have many good places for interproject and interdisciplinary sharing, and that constantly ails and irks me.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-examples">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>More Snack ’n’ Learns that scrutinize past projects for the good, the bad, and the ugly</li>
	<li>I’ve been entertaining the thought for a while that I could just randomly record short <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Looms</a> every now and again of me talking through past projects to post to teams on Slack. Over time, we could build up a collection of these that SuperFriends could watch when they need to. I think the only thing stopping me from doing this is that I haven’t spent time to think about a good format for these and I’m scared of rambling and being incoherent in them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h2>
<h3 id="definition-modeling">Definition</h3>
<p>People often think of mentorship as general guidance, but it’s actually a specific kind of guidance. In <cite>The Odyssey</cite>, Mentor was the person that Odysseus placed in charge of his whole estate—including guidance of his son Telemachus—while Odysseus went off to fight in the Trojan War. Mentor himself actually did a very poor job of all of that, but the goddess of wisdom Athena often transformed into Mentor to work with Telemachus to great success.</p>
<p>In <cite><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/the-odyssey-mentorship/542676/">The Odyssey’s Millennia-Old Model of Mentorship</a></cite>, Harvard classics professor Gregory Nagy points out that Athena’s intention as Mentor was to instill <i lang="el">menos</i> into Telemachus, which <a href="https://www.behindthename.com/element/menos">translates into something like</a> “mind, strength, courage, and force.” So, like Athena did through the guise of Mentor, <strong>mentorship is the act of giving someone else mental, heroic strength from the foundation of wisdom</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-modeling-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>If there’s one thing SuperFriends do, it’s talk. Especially as a company that started <a href="https://toni.org/2010/03/08/5-reasons-why-your-company-should-be-distributed/">distributed</a> in 2012, meetings abound, and delivering mental strength is a core ingredient of those meetings, both internally with SuperFriends only as well as externally with clients.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-modeling">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>A- (excellent).</strong> Mentorship was built into the foundation of SuperFriendly from the beginning, and it persists almost a decade later at a larger scale.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-modeling">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>Counterintuitively, we can do a better job overall by focusing <em>less</em> on mentorship. One thing that’s become abundantly clear is that mentorship alone isn’t enough. We can leave mentorship where it is and dial up some of the other things.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="coaching">Coaching</h2>
<h3 id="definition-coaching">Definition</h3>
<p>In <cite><a href="https://www.coachingperformance.com/">Coaching for Performance</a></cite>, author Sir John Whitmore says <strong>coaching is unlocking people’s potential to maximize their own performance.</strong> I like that definition a lot, and I love that he takes the idea even further. He says, “Coaching is much bigger than coaching. It is a way of being that the whole world needs to get to, where the core theme is compassion for all people.”</p>
<h3 id="how-coaching-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>We have a principle that “everyone at SuperFriendly gets a coach.” If you’re a junior designer, you get paired with a more senior designer. Same for developers. Directors and Producers coach everyone on their team. Directors do 1-on-1s with me, and Producers do 1-on-1s with Crystal. Crystal and I have <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdary">Jen Dary</a> as a coach, and Jen and her team at <a href="https://www.beplucky.com/">Plucky</a> also coach 2 different SuperFriends every quarter.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-coaching">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>A- (excellent).</strong> I think our coaching philosophy program is strong.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-coaching">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>More rigor and regularity for more SuperFriends.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>
<h3 id="definition-modeling">Definition</h3>
<p>Modeling is about intentionally providing behavior for others to observe and imitate.</p>
<h3 id="how-modeling-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>Currently, modeling doesn’t happen as much as we need it to. There’s more mentorship happening than modeling, which has led to a culture of, “Do as I say, not as I do.”</p>
<p>This is also another area where SuperFriendly’s business model works against us. Even our most seasoned SuperFriends don’t always understand well enough what makes a SuperFriendly project different than other kinds of projects because their insight into a volume of SuperFriendly projects is limited. That makes it more difficult for modeling to happen if SuperFriends are unsure which behaviors to model for others. This is one of my biggest responsibilities and failure as SuperFriendly’s <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-modeling">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>F (failing).</strong> In addition to providing <a href="#stories-examples">Stories &amp; Examples</a>, modeling is our biggest gap area.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-modeling">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Our friends at <a href="https://www.seerinteractive.com/">Seer Interactive</a> were kind enough to walk us through their Universal Role Expectations documents for their employees. Among the many excellent things in those documents, my absolute favorite was the column labeled “Sights/Sounds,” which makes clear what an role expectation actually looks and sounds like in real life. For example, an expectation on thought leadership said, “Uses email, chat, and team meetings to ask and answer industry questions and participates in conversations.” The Sights/Sounds column for that expectation says, “I learned how to create this custom report to show me X, and you might also want to use this report and generate others like it. I can show you how.” I love how specific and actionable that is. There’s definitely a version of this in SuperFriendly’s very near future.</li>
	<li>One of my most recent conundrums is that <a href="http://danmall.me/articles/superfriendly-in-2020/">I no longer work on any SuperFriendly projects myself</a>, but I’m one of the most likely candidates to provide useful modeling for our SuperFriends. How can I model good SuperFriend behavior without actually working on projects? I’m stumped about this one.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="direction">Direction</h2>
<h3 id="definition-direction">Definition</h3>
<p>Directing someone is aiming them; it’s giving them a direction, a specific path to tread. A major part of direction is specifically telling someone what to do, and, by virtue of that, signaling to them what <em>not</em> to do and what they can ignore.</p>
<h3 id="how-direction-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>Following the Hollywood model, every SuperFriendly project has a Director as a key role on the project. The Director’s job is to set and reinforce a vision for the project and make sure each SuperFriend knows how the part they play contributes to the overall vision.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-direction">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>C (average).</strong> We provide the space for direction on every project by having a reserved spot for a Director, but providing direction is a tricky dynamic on a SuperFriendly project. Directing is hard, because it’s not <em>just</em> telling someone what to do; getting them to do it is the other half. Because most SuperFriends are independent freelancers, the idea of any kind of manager or boss or someeone telling them what to do that’s not a client is different than it looks at a full-time job. Because of a combination of factors, it’s all too easy for Directors to default more to <a href="#mentorship">mentoring</a> or <a href="#coaching">coaching</a> than directing.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-direction">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>We can definitely provide better role definition for Directors. It’s an ambiguous job, and part of the job is to actually manage ambiguity, but we’re starting to develop a rubric for different ways Directors can operate. Over the next few weeks and months, SuperFriendly will be documenting and delivering more of this clarity for our Directors.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="accountability-partners">Accountability Partners</h2>
<h3 id="definition-accountability-partners">Definition</h3>
<p>Accountability comes from defining standards, having a way to measure whether that standard is being met, and implementing positive and/or negative consequences based on whether the standards are met. (I’ve previously written <a href="http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/accountability/">more about accountability before</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> (which stands for “National Novel Writing Month”) is one of my favorite examples of accountability. The challenge is to write 50,000 words of a novel within the 30 days of November. That’s a daunting enough task for any aspiring novelist, but the simple fact that you know others are doing it with you is extremely motivating for just under 1 million writers that have participated. The positive and negative consequences are simple but effective: once you sign up, you feel embarrassed if you can’t make the commitment you agreed to and you feel amazing if you can.</p>
<h3 id="how-accountability-partners-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>We don’t have anything intentional set up to encourage an accountability partner program, but a few instances of it have cropped up organically. In our apprenticeship program, multiple apprentices at the same skill level within the same cohort have used each other for motivation. And some SuperFriends have taken advantage of our community to proactively reach out to others at the same skill level on other projects for camaraderie and support.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-accountability-partners">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>C (average).</strong> That fact that we haven’t set anything up specifically for this but it’s happening anyway is a promising sign.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-accountability-partners">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Set up an accountability program! That might look like pairing folks together for a period of time with the explicit charge of holding each other accountable, and supporting them in that effort.</li>
	<li>Not exactly directly related, but this brings up the fact that we’ve never explicitly defined our skill levels. That’s definitely a thing that’s on our to-do list for the next few months that I think can have a big impact.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
<h3 id="definition-practice-experience">Definition</h3>
<p>In my opinion, practice is the most important thing on this list for us to support. Practice is the actual application of all of these methods. Without practice, all of these other systems remain purely theoretical exercises.</p>
<p>The late basketball player Kobe Bryant was a student of the game. He unapologetically <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/kobe-bryant-explains-why-he-stole-michael-jordans-moves-3126228">studied and stole all of Michael Jordan’s moves</a>. But what separated Kobe from all the rest? It wasn’t his talent, even though he was extremely talented. It was his work ethic; <a href="https://www.inc.com/matt-given/this-1-quote-from-kobe-bryant-is-all-you-need-to-know-about-his-success.html">Kobe practiced more than everyone else</a>. That’s why he was better.</p>
<h3 id="how-practice-experience-happens">How It Currently Happens at SuperFriendly</h3>
<p>It happens by default. Even though we do provide advisory services to our clients, we’re not just a strategy consultancy. We implement and execute on the work we advise on. That means there are plenty of opportunities for practice.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-practice-experience">My Subjective Assessment</h3>
<p><strong>B (above average).</strong> The question here isn’t whether or not we practice, but <em>what</em> we’re practicing. If it was just about practicing a craft like design or coding, I’d give us an A. But sometimes the thing we should be practicing isn’t obvious. In a scenario where most would design a web page, I want our SuperFriends to practice the discernment that maybe designing a book or an instruction manual would be more useful. What I’d love our SuperFriends to practice more is flexible decision making, not always executing on pre-determined decisions.</p>
<h3 id="better-job-practice-experience">How We Can Do a Better Job</h3>
<p>Create safer spaces through all of the other support systems in order to allow SuperFriends to practice many other things that support their craft.</p>
<hr>
<p>One quick nuance to point out: I often get confused about the different between mentorship, coaching, modeling, and direction. Here’s a cheat sheet I made for myself about what I think the distinctions are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Mentorship</strong> is telling people how you’ve done it.</li>
	<li><strong>Coaching</strong> is helping people do it their own way.</li>
	<li><strong>Modeling</strong> is showing people how you’d do it.</li>
	<li><strong>Direction</strong> is telling people what they should do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I’ve decided to grow SuperFriendly, I’ve had to be more explicit about how we can support all of our SuperFriends. As you can see, we definitely don’t have all of this in place, but making a list like this gives us some standards to meet. I have a hypothesis that the best projects contain every one of these support systems.</p>
<p>If your company does any or all of these support systems well, I’d love to hear about it so we can start implementing the same things to create a better experience for our SuperFriends.</p>
